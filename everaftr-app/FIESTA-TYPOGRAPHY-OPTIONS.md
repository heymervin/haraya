## Typography Pairing 1: Jost + Cormorant Garamond
**Current Build Fonts**

### Google Fonts URL
```
https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Jost:wght@200;300;400;500;600;700&family=Cormorant+Garamond:ital,wght@0,300;0,400;0,500;0,600;1,300;1,400&display=swap
```

### Font Roles
- **Wordmark:** Jost 600 (medium weight)
- **Hero Heading:** Cormorant Garamond 500 (medium serif)
- **Section Headings:** Cormorant Garamond 500
- **Body Text:** Jost 400
- **Buttons:** Jost 500
- **Captions/Small Text:** Jost 400 (smaller size)

### Character
**Elegant, approachable, editorial.**

A classic serif-sans pairing with a friendly sans-serif for UI and a graceful serif for display text. Cormorant Garamond brings editorial sophistication while Jost keeps the interface modern and clean.

### Pros
- Already implemented in codebase (zero migration cost)
- Excellent mobile readability with Jost
- Cormorant Garamond is refined without being stuffy
- Works beautifully with vibrant Fiesta colors — serifs provide elegance to balance the bold palette
- Wide weight range for both fonts allows flexibility

### Cons
- Cormorant Garamond might feel too traditional for the energetic Fiesta concept
- Less playful than other serif options
- Somewhat expected pairing (used by many editorial sites)

### Recommendation for Fiesta
**Good foundation, but could be more distinctive.** This pairing is safe and elegant, but the Fiesta concept's vibrant, celebratory nature might benefit from a serif with more personality.

## Typography Pairing 2: Jost + Playfair Display
**Editorial Elegance**

### Google Fonts URL
```
https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Jost:wght@200;300;400;500;600;700&family=Playfair+Display:ital,wght@400;500;600;700;800;900&display=swap
```

### Font Roles
- **Wordmark:** Playfair Display 600 (medium weight)
- **Hero Heading:** Playfair Display 700
- **Section Headings:** Playfair Display 600
- **Body Text:** Jost 400
- **Buttons:** Jost 600
- **Captions/Small Text:** Jost 400

### Character
**High-contrast, premium, wedding-editorial.**

Playfair Display is a high-contrast serif that screams "wedding" and "editorial sophistication." Paired with Jost's geometric sans-serif, this creates a luxurious, magazine-quality feel. The strong contrast between thick and thin strokes in Playfair adds drama.

### Pros
- Playfair Display is extremely popular in the wedding industry — instant recognition as "premium"
- High contrast creates visual interest and hierarchy
- Jost's clean geometry balances Playfair's drama
- Works beautifully at large sizes (hero headings)
- Playfair has excellent italic variants for emphasis

### Cons
- Playfair can feel overly formal or traditional
- High-contrast serifs can be harder to read at small sizes on mobile
- Very common pairing (used by many wedding sites)
- Might compete with the vibrant Fiesta colors rather than complement them

### Recommendation for Fiesta
**Premium but predictable.** This is a safe, high-quality choice that signals "wedding" immediately, but it might not capture the unique Filipino fiesta energy. Best if you want everaftr to feel luxurious and editorial first, festive second.

## Typography Pairing 3: Jost Solo (Variable Weight)
**Minimalist Modernity**

### Google Fonts URL
```
https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Jost:wght@200;300;400;500;600;700&display=swap
```

### Font Roles
- **Wordmark:** Jost 300 (light, elegant)
- **Hero Heading:** Jost 200-300 (ultra-thin, dramatic spacing)
- **Section Headings:** Jost 500-600 (medium-semibold)
- **Body Text:** Jost 400
- **Buttons:** Jost 600
- **Captions/Small Text:** Jost 300

### Character
**Modern, minimalist, weight-driven hierarchy.**

Instead of mixing fonts, use Jost's wide weight range (200-700) to create hierarchy through weight alone. Ultra-thin weights for hero headings create elegance and breathing room, while heavier weights for buttons and UI create structure.

### Pros
- **Simplicity:** One font family means faster load times, simpler CSS
- **Cohesion:** No font pairing conflicts — everything feels unified
- **Modern:** Very 2020s minimalist aesthetic
- **Let colors shine:** With a single neutral typeface, the vibrant Fiesta palette becomes the hero
- Jost's geometric structure complements the festive, structured aesthetic of Filipino textiles

### Cons
- Lacks the personality of a serif companion
- Thin weights (200-300) can be hard to read on low-quality mobile screens (Android 4G)
- Might feel too minimal for a wedding platform (weddings often demand "special" typography)
- Requires careful hierarchy design to avoid monotony

### Recommendation for Fiesta
**Bold choice, best for a modern brand.** This works if everaftr wants to position itself as the tech-forward, minimalist alternative to traditional wedding planning. The Fiesta colors become the personality, while Jost stays neutral and functional. **This is the most distinctive option** but requires confidence in execution.

## Typography Pairing 4: Jost + Fraunces
**Playful Sophistication**

### Google Fonts URL
```
https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Jost:wght@200;300;400;500;600;700&family=Fraunces:ital,opsz,wght@0,9..144,300;0,9..144,400;0,9..144,500;0,9..144,600;0,9..144,700;1,9..144,400&display=swap
```

### Font Roles
- **Wordmark:** Fraunces 600 (optical size ~72, "wonky" axis for character)
- **Hero Heading:** Fraunces 600 (optical size 144)
- **Section Headings:** Fraunces 500
- **Body Text:** Jost 400
- **Buttons:** Jost 600
- **Captions/Small Text:** Jost 400

### Character
**Quirky, festive, warm, editorial-meets-playful.**

Fraunces is a variable serif with an optional "wonky" axis that makes it slightly playful and characterful. It's sophisticated but not stuffy, elegant but approachable. The optical sizing means it's optimized for both large display use and small text. Paired with Jost, it creates a balance between playfulness and functionality.

### Pros
- **Unique personality:** Fraunces feels fresh and distinctive — not overused like Playfair
- **Perfect for "Fiesta":** The wonky axis adds celebratory energy without being childish
- **Versatile:** Variable font with optical sizing means it adapts to all contexts
- **Warm and approachable:** Feels friendly, not corporate or cold
- **Excellent contrast with Jost:** Jost's geometry vs. Fraunces' organic curves

### Cons
- Variable fonts can have rendering issues on older Android browsers (4G mobile concern)
- The "wonky" axis needs to be used carefully — too much can look unprofessional
- Less recognizable as "wedding typography" than Playfair
- Slightly heavier file size due to variable font axes

### Recommendation for Fiesta
**Top recommendation.** Fraunces captures the spirit of "fiesta" better than any other option — it's elegant, warm, and has personality. The playful-yet-sophisticated character aligns perfectly with Filipino celebrations: joyful, inclusive, and vibrant. This pairing says "we're professional but we don't take ourselves too seriously."

## Typography Pairing 5: Jost + Bricolage Grotesque
**Modern Geometric Character**

### Google Fonts URL
```
https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Jost:wght@200;300;400;500;600;700&family=Bricolage+Grotesque:opsz,wght@12..96,400;12..96,500;12..96,600;12..96,700&display=swap
```

### Font Roles
- **Wordmark:** Bricolage Grotesque 700 (optical size ~96, bold and characterful)
- **Hero Heading:** Bricolage Grotesque 600
- **Section Headings:** Bricolage Grotesque 500
- **Body Text:** Jost 400
- **Buttons:** Jost 600
- **Captions/Small Text:** Jost 400

### Character
**Geometric, quirky, modern, slightly playful.**

Bricolage Grotesque is a sans-serif with character — it's geometric like Jost but has unexpected personality through slightly irregular letterforms and optical sizing. This creates an all-sans pairing with textural contrast rather than serif/sans contrast.

### Pros
- **Distinctive:** Bricolage is less common, giving everaftr a unique voice
- **Geometric harmony:** Both fonts are geometric, creating visual cohesion
- **Modern and fresh:** Feels very 2020s without being trendy
- **Good for mobile:** Both are sans-serifs optimized for screen reading
- **Pairs well with bold colors:** The geometric structure complements the structured Fiesta palette

### Cons
- **No serif softness:** All-sans pairings can feel cold or corporate
- **Less "wedding-y":** Lacks the traditional elegance that brides often expect
- **Subtle contrast:** Both fonts are geometric sans-serifs, so hierarchy must come from weight and size alone
- **Variable font concerns:** Same rendering issues as Fraunces on older devices

### Recommendation for Fiesta
**Best for a bold, modern positioning.** This pairing works if everaftr wants to feel like a tech startup first, wedding platform second. It's confident and contemporary but might alienate users who want traditional wedding elegance. **Consider this if the target demographic skews younger and more urban.**

---

## Overall Recommendation

### For the Fiesta Concept:

**1st Choice: Jost + Fraunces**
Captures the celebratory, warm, inclusive spirit of Filipino fiestas. Elegant enough for weddings, playful enough to feel joyful. The variable optical sizing gives flexibility, and Fraunces' personality pairs beautifully with the vibrant Fiesta color palette.

**2nd Choice: Jost Solo (Variable Weight)**
The most distinctive option. Let the Fiesta colors and banderita accents be the personality while Jost provides clean, modern structure. This is the minimalist, tech-forward approach.

**3rd Choice: Jost + Cormorant Garamond (Current Build)**
Safe and elegant. If you don't want to change fonts, this pairing works well — just lean into bolder use of the Fiesta colors to add the celebratory energy. This is the "don't fix what isn't broken" option.

**Consider Avoiding:**
- **Jost + Playfair Display:** Too wedding-cliché and doesn't align with the unique Filipino fiesta positioning.
- **Jost + Bricolage Grotesque:** Too tech-startup, not warm enough for the wedding industry.

## Implementation Notes

### Performance Considerations
- **Always use `&display=swap`** in Google Fonts URLs to prevent FOIT (Flash of Invisible Text)
- **Load only necessary weights** to minimize file size (critical for 4G mobile users)
- **Variable fonts** (Fraunces, Bricolage Grotesque) offer flexibility but are larger files — test on real mobile devices

### Mobile Readability (Android 4G)
- **Minimum body text size:** 16px (prevents iOS zoom on form inputs)
- **Avoid thin weights below 300** for body text
- **Test on real devices** — Playfair's high contrast can render poorly on low-quality screens
- **Increase line-height for serif body text:** 1.7-1.8 for better readability

### Accessibility
- **WCAG AA contrast:** Ensure text meets 4.5:1 for body, 3:1 for large text
- **Don't use color alone** to convey meaning (supplement with weight, size, or icons)
- **Avoid thin weights for critical UI** (buttons, navigation)

### Banderita Accent
The colorful banderita border should be preserved with all pairings — it's a signature element that works independently of typography choice.

## Next Steps

1. **Review the HTML mockup** (`mockups/fiesta-typography-comparison.html`) to see all pairings side-by-side
2. **Test on real devices** — especially Android on 4G
3. **Consider A/B testing** Jost + Fraunces vs. Jost Solo with real users
4. **Update `src/index.css`** with the chosen pairing
5. **Document the final choice** in CLAUDE.md and BRAND-GUIDE-V2-WOVEN-HERITAGE.md
