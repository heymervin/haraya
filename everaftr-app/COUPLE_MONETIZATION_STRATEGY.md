## 1. Market Context and Sizing

### The Philippine Wedding Market

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Annual registered marriages | ~414,000 (2023) | PSA |
| Average wedding budget (standard, 150 guests) | PHP 122,000 - 584,000 | Multiple sources |
| Average intimate wedding | PHP 50,000 - 250,000 | Nuptials.ph |
| Median household income | ~PHP 372,660/year (~PHP 31,000/month) | PSA projections |
| Middle class monthly income range | PHP 43,828 - 76,669 | PIDS definition |
| Civil ceremony share | 42.9% | PSA |
| Catholic ceremony share | ~33% | PSA |
| Other religious ceremonies | ~24% | PSA |

### Key Insight: A Segmented Market

The Philippine wedding market is not one market. It is at least three:

**Segment A - Budget-Conscious (est. 55% of couples, ~228,000/yr)**
- Wedding budget: PHP 50,000 - 200,000
- Household income: PHP 20,000 - 43,000/month
- Heavily reliant on Facebook groups for vendor discovery
- Extremely price-sensitive on tools; will not pay for digital products
- High use of civil and non-traditional ceremonies

**Segment B - Middle-Market (est. 35% of couples, ~145,000/yr)**
- Wedding budget: PHP 200,000 - 600,000
- Household income: PHP 43,000 - 80,000/month
- Willing to pay for convenience and time savings
- Active on Facebook but open to dedicated platforms
- Mix of Catholic, Christian, and civil ceremonies

**Segment C - Premium (est. 10% of couples, ~41,000/yr)**
- Wedding budget: PHP 600,000+
- Household income: PHP 80,000+/month
- Will pay for quality and personalization
- May hire professional wedding planners
- Destination weddings, large guest lists

**everaftr's primary target is Segment B** with spillover into the upper end of Segment A and lower end of Segment C. This is the segment large enough to drive volume, digitally savvy enough to adopt a platform, and willing to pay for genuine value.

### Competitive Landscape (Philippines-Specific)

| Competitor | Type | Couple Cost | Strength | Weakness |
|-----------|------|-------------|----------|----------|
| Kasal.com | Directory | Free | Established since 2001 | Dated UX, no planning tools |
| Bride & Breakfast | Content + Directory | Free | Strong brand, editorial trust | Content-first, not a tool |
| WeddingsAtWork | Community + Directory | Free | Large Facebook community | Facebook-dependent, fragmented |
| Facebook Groups | Organic community | Free | Massive reach, real reviews | Unstructured, overwhelming, no tools |
| Google Sheets | DIY tool | Free | Flexible, familiar | No wedding-specific features |
| The Knot/Zola/Joy | International platforms | Free (mostly) | Full-featured | Not localized for PH market |

**everaftr's positioning gap:** No Philippine platform currently combines vendor discovery, planning tools, AND a couple-facing website/RSVP system in one integrated experience. The competitors are either directories without tools, tools without directories, or international platforms without Philippine market fit.

---

## 2. Core Strategic Principle

**"Free makes the marketplace. Premium makes the business sustainable on both sides."**

The fundamental economics of a two-sided marketplace dictate that you subsidize the demand side (couples) to build liquidity for the supply side (vendors). The Knot, Zola, and WeddingWire all learned this. Couples must get extraordinary value for free.

However, everaftr operates in a market where:
- Vendor monetization will take time to scale (you have 80 vendors now, not 8,000)
- The Philippine market may not support the same vendor advertising CPMs as the US
- There is a window to establish premium couple features before competitors copy them

**The strategy therefore is: be generous with free, be surgical with premium.**

Premium couple features should meet ALL THREE of these criteria:
1. They require meaningful ongoing infrastructure cost (hosting, SMS, domains)
2. They deliver value that couples can directly quantify (time saved, stress reduced)
3. They do NOT gatekeep the features that drive the viral loop or marketplace liquidity

---

## 3. Free Forever Tier - The Acquisition Engine

### What Stays Free and Why

| Feature | Free Forever? | Strategic Rationale |
|---------|:------------:|---------------------|
| Vendor Directory (search, filter, browse) | YES | Core marketplace loop. Couples searching = leads for vendors. Gatekeeping this kills the marketplace. |
| Planning Checklist (all 44 items, ceremony filtering) | YES | Key "utility hook" that gets couples to return weekly. Drives habit formation. |
| Budget Tracker (basic) | YES | Paired with checklist, this is the "Google Sheets replacement" argument. Keeps couples on-platform. |
| Matchmaker Quiz | YES | Delightful first-touch experience. Low cost to serve. Drives social sharing. |
| Wedding Website (standard templates) | YES | THE viral growth engine. Every guest who views = brand impression. Cannot be premium-gated. |
| RSVP Collection (basic) | YES | Inseparable from wedding website value. Must be free for viral loop to work. |
| Guest List Manager (basic: add/edit/track RSVP status) | YES | Natural extension of RSVP. If RSVP is free but guest list is paid, the experience breaks. |
| Vendor Profiles (view details, photos, pricing) | YES | Marketplace liquidity. Couples must be able to evaluate vendors freely. |
| Favorites/Shortlist (save vendors) | YES | Engagement driver. Low cost to serve. Improves vendor lead quality data. |

### Why This Generosity is Correct

The free tier is designed to give a couple everything they need to plan a basic wedding digitally. This is critical because:

1. **The competition is free.** Facebook groups, Google Sheets, and Kasal.com cost nothing. If everaftr's free tier is not demonstrably better than these, couples will not switch.

2. **Every couple on the platform generates vendor value.** Even a couple who never pays a peso makes the vendor directory more valuable by contributing to vendor reviews, generating lead signals, and expanding the brand through their wedding website.

3. **The Philippine market context demands it.** With median household income at ~PHP 31,000/month and wedding budgets already stretching finances, asking couples to pay for basic planning tools is a non-starter for the majority of the market.

4. **Viber sharing creates exponential reach.** With 71% penetration in the Philippines, Viber is the channel. Every free wedding website shared via Viber is free marketing to 50-200 guests per couple.

---

## 4. Premium Tier - "everaftr Plus"

### Positioning the Premium Tier

Premium is NOT about gatekeeping basic functionality. It is about offering **upgrades that make a good experience extraordinary** -- things that couples would otherwise pay a separate vendor or service to provide.

The mental model for the Filipino couple should be: "I can plan my entire wedding for free on everaftr. But for the price of one restaurant dinner, I can make it significantly easier and more polished."

### Premium Feature Set

#### Tier 1: "everaftr Plus" (Primary Premium Offering)

**A. Wedding Website Upgrades**

| Feature | Description | Why It Works |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Premium Templates (8-12 designs) | Elevated visual design. Think: Canva Pro vs. Canva Free. Modern, editorial-quality layouts with animation, parallax scrolling, multiple page sections. | Filipino couples already spend PHP 3,000-15,000 on wedding invitations. A beautiful digital invitation/website replaces or complements this. The perceived value is concrete. |
| Custom Domain | maria-and-juan.everaftr.ph (subdomain) or maria-and-juan.com (BYO domain support) | Vanity matters. Couples already pay for printed materials with their names. A personalized URL they share on Viber and print on physical invites has real perceived value. .everaftr.ph subdomains are near-zero cost to serve. |
| Custom Color Palette and Font Pairing | Go beyond template defaults. Choose from a curated set of 20+ color palettes and font combinations. | Differentiation from other couples on the same platform. "My website looks unique" is a genuine emotional need. |
| Background Music | Upload or select from a curated library of royalty-free tracks for the website. | Culturally resonant. Filipino wedding culture values ambiance and sentimentality. |
| Photo Gallery with Prenup Photos | Multi-layout gallery (grid, carousel, lightbox) for engagement/prenuptial photos. Free tier gets a single hero image. | Prenuptial photoshoots are a major Filipino wedding tradition. Couples spend PHP 10,000-40,000 on prenup photos and want to showcase them. |
| Password-Protected Pages | Private pages for logistics (directions, hotel blocks, etc.) visible only to guests with the password. | Practical for couples managing different guest groups with different access levels. |

**B. Advanced Guest Management**

| Feature | Description | Why It Works |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Seating Chart Builder | Visual drag-and-drop seating arrangement tool with table templates (round, rectangular, custom). | This is one of the most stressful parts of wedding planning. Currently done on paper or in PowerPoint. A dedicated tool saves hours and reduces couple arguments. |
| Meal Preference Tracking | Collect dietary preferences and meal choices during RSVP. Export for caterer. | Directly reduces vendor coordination effort. Caterers will appreciate receiving structured data. |
| Viber/SMS RSVP Reminders | Automated reminders to guests who have not responded, sent via Viber or SMS. | This is the killer feature. Filipino culture involves significant follow-up with guests. Currently done manually, one by one. Automating this saves enormous time and social stress. |
| Guest Group Management | Tag guests by group (groom's family, bride's college friends, work colleagues). Assign different events to different groups. | Essential for couples with multiple events (church ceremony, reception, after-party, day-after brunch). |
| RSVP Analytics | Dashboard showing response rates, confirmed vs. pending vs. declined, timeline trends. | Reduces anxiety. Couples check "how many have confirmed" constantly. A visual dashboard beats counting rows in a spreadsheet. |

**C. Planning Upgrades**

| Feature | Description | Why It Works |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Wedding Day Timeline Generator | Input ceremony time, and the tool generates a suggested timeline (hair/makeup, first look, ceremony, cocktails, reception, etc.) with vendor coordination notes. | Professional wedding coordinators charge PHP 15,000-50,000. A basic automated timeline gives DIY couples a framework that would otherwise require hiring help. |
| Vendor Comparison Tool | Side-by-side comparison of up to 3 shortlisted vendors with pricing, reviews, services, and availability. | Saves hours of flipping between tabs and screenshots. High-intent couples (close to booking) find this most valuable. |
| Budget Tracker Pro | Budget vs. actual tracking with payment schedule, deposit reminders, and vendor payment status. | The free budget tracker handles totals. Pro tracks cash flow -- critical when couples are making deposits across 8-15 vendors over 6-12 months. |

**D. Post-Wedding Features**

| Feature | Description | Why It Works |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Thank-You Tracker | Mark which guests have been thanked. Generate thank-you message templates (Viber-optimized). | Filipino wedding culture strongly emphasizes gratitude (pasasalamat). Couples send individual thanks to guests who gave gifts. Tracking this across 100-300 guests is a real pain point. |
| Digital Photo Album | Convert wedding website into a permanent keepsake page with photo uploads from the event. | Extends platform engagement beyond the wedding date. Emotional value is high. |
| Wedding Website Archive | Keep the wedding website live for 2 years after the wedding date (free sites archived after 6 months). | Low cost to serve. Creates long-tail brand impressions as friends continue to visit. |

### What is NOT Premium (and Why)

| Feature | Status | Rationale |
|---------|--------|-----------|
| Basic vendor messaging | FREE | Messaging is the conversion mechanism for the marketplace. Gatekeeping it reduces vendor leads and breaks the value proposition. |
| Basic RSVP | FREE | Inseparable from the free wedding website. The viral loop depends on guests being able to RSVP without the couple paying. |
| Basic guest list | FREE | Same rationale as RSVP. Cannot separate them without a broken experience. |
| Vendor reviews/ratings | FREE | User-generated content that improves the platform for everyone. Should be incentivized, not restricted. |

## 5. Pricing Strategy for the Philippine Market

### Price Anchoring: What Filipino Couples Already Pay For

To price correctly, we must anchor against what couples already spend on comparable value:

| Existing Expense | Typical Cost | everaftr Equivalent |
|-----------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Printed wedding invitations (100 pcs) | PHP 5,000 - 20,000 | Premium wedding website + digital invites |
| Wedding coordinator (day-of) | PHP 15,000 - 50,000 | Timeline generator + checklist + vendor tracking |
| DIY seating chart (hours of manual work) | 4-8 hours of couple's time | Seating chart builder |
| Manual Viber follow-ups for RSVP | 2-3 weeks of daily messages | Automated RSVP reminders |
| Thank-you card printing | PHP 2,000 - 5,000 | Digital thank-you tracker |

**Total comparable value: PHP 24,000 - 75,000+**

### Pricing Model: One-Time Payment (NOT Subscription)

**Critical decision: Do not use monthly subscriptions.**

Rationale specific to the Philippine market:

1. **Wedding planning is a finite activity.** Couples plan for 6-18 months, then they are done. A subscription feels like it punishes slower planners.

2. **Filipino consumers are subscription-fatigued.** Spotify at PHP 169/month and Netflix at PHP 169-619/month already compete for wallet share. Adding another monthly charge triggers resistance.

3. **One-time payments feel like a purchase, not a tax.** Filipino consumers are more comfortable with transactional purchases ("I bought this for my wedding") than recurring charges.

4. **Eliminates churn as a metric.** You do not need to worry about couples canceling before the wedding. They pay once, they get the value.

### Recommended Price Points

#### everaftr Plus -- PHP 499 one-time

**Includes ALL premium features listed in Section 4.**

| Element | Rationale |
|---------|-----------|
| **PHP 499** | Below the PHP 500 psychological threshold. Equivalent to ~USD 8.80 at current exchange rates. |
| **One-time, not monthly** | For the full planning cycle (up to 18 months of access from purchase date, extendable to wedding date + 3 months for post-wedding features). |
| **Price as % of wedding budget** | At PHP 499 vs. an average wedding budget of PHP 300,000, this is 0.17% of total wedding spend. Negligible. |
| **Anchored to familiar spending** | Less than a dinner out for two at a mid-range restaurant in Manila (PHP 600-1,000). Less than a Grab ride across the city. |
| **Comparable to Spotify** | About 3 months of Spotify Premium. For a tool you will use intensively for 6-18 months. |

#### Custom Domain Add-On -- PHP 199/year

| Element | Rationale |
|---------|-----------|
| **PHP 199/year** | Covers domain registration/subdomain infrastructure costs. Comparable to Zola/Joy at ~USD 15/year. |
| **Sold as add-on** | Not bundled into Plus because not every couple wants it. Keeps Plus price low. |
| **.everaftr.ph subdomain** | Near-zero cost to serve. Brand-building for everaftr. Couples get a clean URL. |
| **BYO domain support** | For couples who want maria-and-juan.com. They buy the domain themselves; everaftr handles DNS configuration. |

#### Launch Pricing Strategy

| Phase | Pricing | Duration | Purpose |
|-------|---------|----------|---------|
| **Early Access** | PHP 199 (60% off) | First 500 couples | Build initial premium user base. Generate testimonials. Price anchoring -- "originally PHP 499." |
| **Launch Promo** | PHP 349 (30% off) | Months 2-4 | Transition pricing. Create urgency. |
| **Standard** | PHP 499 | Ongoing | Sustainable price point. |
| **Wedding Season Promos** | PHP 399 (20% off) | June, December peaks | Seasonal demand capture during peak wedding planning months. |

#### Payment Methods

Given the Philippine market, support ALL of the following:

- GCash (94 million users)
- Maya (formerly PayMaya)
- Credit/debit card (Visa, Mastercard)
- Over-the-counter (7-Eleven, Cebuana Lhuillier via payment partners like Dragonpay or PayMongo)
- Bank transfer (InstaPay/PESONet)

**GCash and Maya must be the primary payment options.** Many target couples do not have credit cards. GCash alone covers the vast majority of the digitally active population.

## 6. Wedding Website as Viral Growth Engine

### The Viral Loop Mechanics

```
Couple creates free wedding website on everaftr
         |
         v
Couple shares RSVP link via Viber to 100-300 guests
         |
         v
Guests visit the wedding website to RSVP
         |
         v
Guests see everaftr branding and experience the product
         |
         v
Some guests are themselves engaged or planning a wedding
         |
         v
They create their own everaftr wedding website
         |
         v
LOOP REPEATS
```

### Quantifying the Viral Potential

| Metric | Conservative Estimate | Optimistic Estimate |
|--------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Average guests per wedding | 100 | 200 |
| % who visit the website to RSVP | 60% | 80% |
| Unique visitors per couple's site | 60 | 160 |
| % of visitors who are couples aged 25-35 | 15% | 20% |
| % of those who are planning/will plan a wedding within 12 months | 10% | 15% |
| New couple sign-ups per existing couple | 0.9 | 4.8 |

**A viral coefficient above 1.0 means organic growth without any paid acquisition.** Even the conservative scenario is close to viral. The optimistic scenario suggests each couple could bring in nearly 5 new couples.

Filipino weddings skew larger than Western weddings (100-300 guests is typical), and Filipino social networks are dense (extended family, college barkada, work colleagues). The cultural context amplifies virality.

### Maximizing the Loop Without Being a Billboard

The tension: everaftr branding on wedding websites drives awareness, but couples will resent heavy-handed branding on "their" site. The solution is **tasteful presence with genuine value**.

#### Do This (Adds Value)

1. **"Powered by everaftr" footer link** -- Small, tasteful, links to everaftr homepage. This is the standard approach (WordPress, Squarespace, Carrd all do this). Couples expect it on a free product. Premium users could optionally remove it, but the recommended approach is to keep it even for premium with better styling.

2. **"Planning your own wedding?" CTA on RSVP confirmation page** -- After a guest submits their RSVP, show a confirmation ("Thank you! Your RSVP has been recorded.") followed by a soft prompt: "Planning your own wedding? Create your free wedding website on everaftr." This is the highest-intent moment -- the guest just experienced the product's value.

3. **"Made with everaftr" on Viber link preview** -- When the wedding website link is shared on Viber, the Open Graph preview should include a subtle "Made with everaftr" in the description or as part of the preview image. This is the first brand touchpoint for guests, before they even click.

4. **Guest-side features that showcase the platform** -- If everaftr offers photo sharing or guestbook features accessible to guests, each interaction deepens brand familiarity. A guest who uploads a photo during the reception has a much deeper product experience than one who just RSVPs.

#### Do NOT Do This (Destroys Trust)

1. **Pop-up ads or interstitials on the wedding website** -- This is the couple's special page. Interrupting the guest experience with ads would be a betrayal of trust and would kill word-of-mouth.

2. **Collecting guest email/phone for marketing without consent** -- Guests provided their information to RSVP for a wedding, not to receive marketing emails. Violating this boundary is both unethical and would trigger negative word-of-mouth in Filipino social circles (which are tight and vocal).

3. **Heavy branding that competes with the couple's content** -- The everaftr logo should never be larger than the couple's names. The branding should feel like a credit, not a co-host.

4. **Vendor ads on the wedding website** -- Even if vendors pay for it, inserting vendor promotions on a couple's wedding page destroys the product's integrity.

### Viber-Specific Optimization

Given Viber's 71% penetration in the Philippines, the wedding website sharing flow should be Viber-first:

1. **"Share on Viber" as the primary sharing button** -- Above email, above Facebook, above copy-link. The button should use Viber's brand color (purple) and be the most visually prominent option.

2. **Pre-composed Viber message** -- When the couple taps "Share on Viber," pre-fill the message with something like: "[Couple's names] invite you to their wedding! RSVP here: [link]". Let the couple edit before sending.

3. **Viber Community/Group integration** -- Many Filipino families have Viber groups. Allow sharing to Viber groups with a single tap.

4. **QR code generation** -- For couples who also have printed invitations, generate a QR code that links to the wedding website. Guests scan and RSVP instantly. This bridges the physical-digital gap that is common in Filipino weddings where printed invitations are still valued.

5. **Link preview optimization** -- Ensure the Open Graph tags generate a beautiful Viber preview: couple's photo, their names, wedding date, and a clean "RSVP on everaftr" call-to-action. Viber previews are the first impression. Make them count.

## 7. Partnership Revenue Opportunities

### Tier 1: High Potential (Pursue in Year 1)

#### A. GCash/Maya Digital Cash Gift Registry

**The Opportunity:**
Filipino wedding culture centers on "monetary gifts" (cash in envelopes). This is not a Western-style registry culture with wishlists from department stores. The digital equivalent is enabling guests to send cash gifts via GCash or Maya directly through the wedding website.

**How It Works:**
- Couple links their GCash/Maya account to their everaftr wedding website
- A "Send a Gift" button appears on the website
- Guests tap to send a cash gift, with optional preset amounts (PHP 500, 1,000, 2,000, 5,000)
- everaftr takes a small processing convenience fee (1-2%) or offers it free with branding

**Revenue Model:**
- Option A: 1.5% convenience fee on transactions (transparent to both parties)
- Option B: Free for couples, monetized via partnership deal with GCash/Maya (they pay for user acquisition/transaction volume)
- Option C: Free for all, used purely as a growth driver and vendor-side selling point ("our couples process PHP X million in gifts")

**Why This Works in the Philippines:**
- Cash gifting is already the norm. No behavior change required.
- GCash has 94 million users. The payment infrastructure exists.
- Removes the awkwardness of physical cash handling at the reception
- Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs) -- family members abroad who cannot attend -- can send gifts digitally. This is a massive unmet need.

**Estimated Revenue (Option A):**
- If 10,000 couples use this feature per year
- Average cash gifts received per couple: PHP 50,000
- Total gift volume: PHP 500,000,000
- 1.5% fee: PHP 7,500,000/year (significant revenue stream)

#### B. Vendor Booking Deposits via Platform

**The Opportunity:**
When couples find and choose vendors through everaftr, facilitate the deposit payment through the platform.

**Revenue Model:**
- 2-3% processing fee (transparent)
- Or negotiated revenue share with payment processor

**Why This Matters:**
- Creates a closed loop: discover vendor, message vendor, book vendor, pay vendor -- all on everaftr
- Gives everaftr transaction data that proves ROI to vendors ("couples booked PHP X through our platform")
- Protects couples (deposit dispute resolution)

### Tier 2: Medium Potential (Pursue in Year 1-2)

#### C. Honeymoon Travel Partnerships

**The Opportunity:**
Partner with Philippine travel platforms (Guide to the Philippines, Klook PH, Traveloka PH) to offer honeymoon package deals.

**How It Works:**
- Curated honeymoon section on everaftr (Boracay, Palawan, Siargao, Bohol packages)
- Couples browse and book through affiliate links
- everaftr earns 5-10% affiliate commission

**Revenue Estimate:**
- Average honeymoon spend: PHP 30,000 - 80,000
- If 5% of couples book through everaftr: ~20,000 bookings/year at PHP 50,000 avg
- 7% commission: PHP 70,000,000 (this is optimistic; actual take depends on attribution)

**Realistic near-term:** Start with affiliate links and measure conversion before pursuing deeper integration.

#### D. Wedding Insurance (Partnership with Local Insurer)

**The Opportunity:**
Wedding insurance is virtually nonexistent in the Philippines as a standalone product. First-mover advantage is available.

**Potential Partner:** Pioneer Insurance, Malayan Insurance, or FPG Insurance

**Product Concept:**
- Cancellation/postponement coverage (weather, venue closure, vendor no-show)
- PHP 5,000 - 15,000 premium for PHP 100,000 - 500,000 coverage
- Sold through everaftr as an embedded insurance product

**Revenue Model:** 15-25% commission on premiums

**Caution:** This requires a licensed insurance partner and regulatory compliance. It is a Year 2+ initiative. But positioning everaftr as the first platform to offer wedding insurance in the Philippines would generate significant PR and differentiation.

### Tier 3: Longer-Term (Year 2+)

#### E. Wedding Loan/Installment Partnerships

**The Opportunity:**
Partner with digital lenders (Tonik, Maya Credit, Home Credit) to offer wedding financing.

**Sensitivity Note:** This must be handled with extreme care. everaftr should never be predatory or encourage couples to take on excessive debt. If pursued, position it as: "Spread your vendor payments over 6-12 months at reasonable rates" rather than "Borrow more for a bigger wedding."

**Revenue Model:** Referral fee per qualified application (PHP 500 - 2,000)

#### F. Wedding Supplier Marketplace (Physical Goods)

**The Opportunity:**
Curated marketplace for wedding supplies (souvenirs, decorations, DIY materials) from Philippine-based sellers.

**Revenue Model:** 10-15% commission on sales

**This is lower priority** because it moves everaftr away from its core value proposition (planning platform) into e-commerce territory, which requires different capabilities.

---

## 8. Revenue Model and Projections

### Revenue Mix Strategy

everaftr should pursue a **diversified revenue model** rather than depending on any single stream:

| Revenue Stream | Type | Year 1 Target | Year 2 Target | Year 3 Target |
|---------------|------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| **Vendor subscriptions/leads** | B2B recurring | 60% | 50% | 40% |
| **everaftr Plus (couple premium)** | B2C one-time | 15% | 20% | 20% |
| **Cash gift processing fees** | Transaction fee | 0% (building) | 15% | 20% |
| **Affiliate/partnership revenue** | Commission | 5% | 10% | 15% |
| **Custom domains** | B2C add-on | 2% | 5% | 5% |

**Vendor monetization remains the primary revenue source**, consistent with global wedding platform economics. Couple-side revenue is supplementary but meaningful, and it grows as the couple base scales.

### Couple-Side Revenue Projections (Conservative)

**Assumptions:**
- Year 1: 5,000 active couples on platform
- Year 2: 25,000 active couples
- Year 3: 80,000 active couples
- Premium conversion rate: 5% (Year 1), 7% (Year 2), 8% (Year 3)
- Average premium revenue per paying couple: PHP 550 (Plus + some domains)

| Metric | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Active couples | 5,000 | 25,000 | 80,000 |
| Premium conversions | 250 | 1,750 | 6,400 |
| Premium revenue | PHP 137,500 | PHP 962,500 | PHP 3,520,000 |
| Cash gift processing | PHP 0 | PHP 2,625,000 | PHP 12,000,000 |
| Domain add-ons | PHP 12,450 | PHP 174,125 | PHP 637,600 |
| Affiliate revenue | PHP 50,000 | PHP 500,000 | PHP 2,000,000 |
| **Total couple-side revenue** | **PHP 199,950** | **PHP 4,261,625** | **PHP 18,157,600** |

**Year 3 couple-side revenue of ~PHP 18.2 million (~USD 321,000) is meaningful but not transformative on its own.** This underscores why vendor-side revenue must remain the primary business model, with couple-side revenue as a profitable supplement and the cash gift processing fee as the highest-growth opportunity.

## 10. Risks and Mitigations

### Risk 1: Couples Will Not Pay for Premium Features

**Likelihood:** Medium
**Impact:** Low (vendor monetization is primary revenue anyway)

**Mitigation:**
- Keep the price extremely low (PHP 499 is designed to be an impulse purchase)
- Validate feature demand before building (survey couples, test with mockups)
- If premium conversion is below 3% after 6 months, consider reducing price to PHP 299 or restructuring the feature bundle
- The cash gift processing fee does not require couples to pay -- it is a transaction fee that guests absorb or that is split

### Risk 2: Viber/Social Sharing Does Not Produce Viral Growth

**Likelihood:** Low (Filipino social sharing behavior is strong)
**Impact:** High (growth depends on viral loop)

**Mitigation:**
- Invest heavily in the Viber sharing experience (preview quality, message templates)
- A/B test the RSVP confirmation CTA relentlessly
- Add a secondary viral loop: "Share your wedding website on Facebook" for additional reach
- If organic virality is below 0.5 coefficient, invest in paid acquisition as a supplement (Facebook/Instagram ads targeting engaged couples)

### Risk 3: GCash/Maya Partnership Takes Too Long

**Likelihood:** Medium-High (large companies move slowly)
**Impact:** Medium (delays the highest-growth revenue stream)

**Mitigation:**
- Start with PayMongo or Dragonpay as payment facilitators (they already support GCash/Maya as payment methods)
- You do not need a direct partnership with GCash/Maya to accept their payments. Use an intermediary.
- The direct partnership (co-marketing, deeper integration) is a Year 2 goal

### Risk 4: A Competitor Copies the Model

**Likelihood:** Medium (Kasal.com or Bride & Breakfast could build similar tools)
**Impact:** Medium

**Mitigation:**
- Speed is the moat. Launch first, iterate fast, build brand loyalty.
- The inclusive positioning (ceremony-type filtering, LGBTQ+ friendly, civil ceremony support) is a genuine differentiator that established players may not replicate due to advertiser pressure.
- Network effects: once couples and vendors are on the platform, switching costs increase.
- Data advantage: the more couples use everaftr, the better the vendor recommendations, budget estimates, and planning suggestions become.

### Risk 5: Premium Features Reduce Viral Loop Effectiveness

**Likelihood:** Low (the free tier is designed to be complete)
**Impact:** High (if perceived as a "freemium trap")

**Mitigation:**
- The free wedding website must be genuinely good -- not a crippled version of premium.
- Free templates should look modern and polished, not deliberately ugly to upsell.
- The "Powered by everaftr" footer should be the only visible difference between free and premium websites from a guest's perspective.
- Regularly test: "Would you recommend everaftr to a friend?" among free-tier users. If NPS drops, the free tier needs improvement.

## Summary of Key Decisions

| Decision | Recommendation | Confidence |
|----------|---------------|------------|
| What stays free | Directory, checklist, budget tracker, basic wedding website + RSVP, basic guest list, matchmaker quiz, vendor profiles, favorites | High |
| What is premium | Premium templates, custom domain, seating chart, Viber reminders, meal tracking, timeline generator, vendor comparison, post-wedding tools | High |
| Pricing model | One-time payment, not subscription | High |
| Price point | PHP 499 (everaftr Plus) + PHP 199/yr (custom domain) | Medium-High |
| Biggest couple-side revenue opportunity | GCash/Maya cash gift processing fee | High |
| Viral loop strategy | Free wedding website shared via Viber with soft CTA on RSVP confirmation | High |
| Primary revenue source (overall) | Vendor-side monetization (consistent with global wedding platform economics) | High |

## Final Note

The couple-side monetization strategy for everaftr is not about extracting maximum revenue from couples. It is about building a platform so valuable that couples voluntarily upgrade for convenience, and so widely used that the vendor side becomes the real business. The cash gift processing integration is the single most important couple-side revenue initiative because it aligns with existing Filipino behavior (cash gifting), requires no behavior change, and scales with platform adoption.

The free tier must be excellent. Not "good enough." Excellent. Because in the Philippines, the real competition is not another wedding platform -- it is the Facebook group admin who posts vendor lists for free, the tita who has a Google Sheet template, and the barkada group chat where everyone shares recommendations. everaftr must be so much better than these free alternatives that couples choose it without hesitation, and then so delightful that some of them happily pay PHP 499 to make it even better.
