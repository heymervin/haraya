# HARAYA BRAND CONCEPT REVIEW
## Head of Marketing & Branding Strategy Assessment
### Date: February 9, 2026

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This document provides a comprehensive marketing and branding evaluation of the proposed "Haraya" rebrand for a Filipino wedding planning platform, formerly conceptualized as "everaftr" with a Fiesta visual identity. The review covers naming strategy, visual positioning, target market fit, competitive analysis, risks, opportunities, and a final scored verdict with recommendations.

**Bottom line up front:** The Haraya concept demonstrates sophisticated brand thinking and strong cultural grounding, but it carries meaningful risks around name saturation, aesthetic-to-action friction, and performance on the target device ecosystem. A hybrid approach may deliver the strongest outcome.

## 1. NAME ANALYSIS: "HARAYA" vs "EVERAFTR"

### 1.1 Brand Recall & Memorability

**everaftr**
- Instantly recognizable concept: "ever after" is a universal phrase tied to weddings, fairy tales, and lasting love.
- The dropped letters ("e" in "ever," "e" in "forever") give it a modern, tech-startup feel similar to Tumblr, Flickr, Grindr.
- English-language base means it works internationally.
- Risk: The "clever misspelling" trend is aging. It peaked around 2010-2015 and may feel dated to Gen Z couples in 2026.

**Haraya**
- Beautiful Filipino word. Means imagination, dream, creative vision.
- Two-syllable feel (ha-RA-ya) is rhythmic and memorable once learned.
- Problem: It requires explanation. The word is not commonly used in everyday Tagalog conversation. It is a literary/poetic term. Many Filipino millennials may know "hiraya" (as in "hiraya manawari") but may not immediately connect "haraya" to dreams and imagination without context.
- For non-Filipino speakers (destination wedding couples, expat Filipinos with non-Filipino partners), the word is opaque.

**Verdict on Recall:** everaftr wins on instant recognition. Haraya wins on depth and cultural distinctiveness once the meaning is understood. The gap narrows significantly with good marketing, but the initial barrier is real.

### 1.2 Domain & Handle Availability

**Critical Finding: haraya.com is already taken.** It belongs to a Filipino creative ecosystem organization (Haraya, Inc.) that nurtures creative Filipino talent and has multiple sub-brands including Simoy ng Haraya (home scents), Haraya Clo (fashion), and Haraya Threads (clothing). This is a serious problem:

- haraya.com is occupied by an active, funded Filipino brand ecosystem
- haraya.ph availability is uncertain but faces brand confusion risk
- @haraya on Instagram is almost certainly taken given the number of active Haraya-branded businesses

**Other "Haraya" brands already in the Philippine market:**
- Haraya Coaching (professional coaching platform)
- Haraya Clo (sustainable fashion)
- Haraya Threads (cultural fashion line)
- Simoy ng Haraya (home and body scents)

**And closely related:**
- Hiraya Pilipina (lifestyle/innerwear brand)
- Hiraya The Shop (handwoven goods)
- Hiraya Creative Co. (design studio)

This is a crowded namespace. The word "haraya" and its close variant "hiraya" are already heavily used by Filipino brands. You would not be carving out a unique space -- you would be joining a crowded field of Filipino brands using the same culturally-loaded word.

**everaftr** has fewer namespace conflicts. The misspelling creates natural trademark distinctiveness, and everaftr.ph is more likely to be available.

**Verdict on Naming Rights:** everaftr has a clear advantage. Haraya faces a trademark and brand confusion minefield.

### 1.3 SEO Implications

Searching "haraya" returns results for:
- Haraya.com (creative ecosystem)
- Haraya Clo
- Haraya Threads
- Haraya Coaching
- Multiple Hiraya-branded businesses

A wedding platform called "Haraya" would need to compete for its own brand name in search results from day one. This is a significant and costly SEO disadvantage. You would likely need to brand as "Haraya Weddings" or "Haraya PH" to differentiate, which dilutes the clean one-word brand concept.

"everaftr" has much less competition for its exact-match search term due to the unique spelling.

### 1.4 Pronunciation

- **Haraya:** Straightforward for Filipino speakers. Non-Filipino speakers may default to "hah-RAY-ah" or "hah-RYE-ah" -- both are close enough. This is a minor concern.
- **everaftr:** Universally pronounceable but requires explanation of the missing letters in text communication. "Is that e-v-e-r-a-f-t-r?"

**Verdict:** Roughly equal. Both have minor friction points.

### 1.5 Cultural Resonance with Filipino Couples 25-35

This is where Haraya has genuine strength -- but it is not as strong as it first appears.

The word "haraya" is poetic and aspirational, but it is not a word most Filipino couples use in daily conversation. It is not like "kasal" (wedding) or "pamilya" (family), which are viscerally everyday words. Haraya lives in the literary register. For couples who are well-read or culturally attuned, it will resonate deeply. For the broader market of 25-35-year-olds planning weddings on PHP 100K-1M budgets, it may feel unfamiliar or pretentious.

The tagline "where dreams take shape" does good work explaining the concept, but it is generic. Many brands use "dreams" in wedding contexts.

By contrast, "plan together, celebrate forevr" (the everaftr tagline) is action-oriented and immediately communicates what the platform does and the relationship dynamic it supports.

**Verdict:** Haraya resonates with a specific (educated, culturally-aware, Instagram-aesthetic) subset of the target market. everaftr resonates more broadly but less deeply.

### 1.6 Emotional Associations

| Dimension | everaftr | Haraya |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| Primary emotion | Commitment, forever love | Dreams, possibility |
| Wedding connection | Direct ("ever after") | Indirect (imagination) |
| Action orientation | Medium (implies an outcome) | Low (implies a state of mind) |
| Warmth | High | Medium |
| Sophistication | Medium | High |
| Uniqueness in PH market | Medium | Low (many Haraya brands) |

## 2. VISUAL POSITIONING

### 2.1 Lavender as Primary Color: Unique or Risky?

**The Good News:**
- Lavender is genuinely differentiated in the Philippine wedding platform space. Current competitors use:
  - Brideworthy: Pink/magenta
  - Kasal.com: Blue/traditional
  - Bride and Breakfast: Beige/neutral/editorial
  - eKasal: Blue/white
- Lavender is trending globally for 2025-2026 weddings. It is being called "the new blush" in Western wedding publications.
- Gen Z purple/lavender has been identified as a generational signature color, similar to how millennial pink defined the previous generation. This is well-documented across branding and fashion trend reports.

**The Risk:**
- Trend-following is dangerous for a platform brand. If lavender is "the new blush" for 2025-2026 weddings, it may feel dated by 2028-2029. A platform brand needs to outlast seasonal color trends.
- Dream Lavender #9D8BD8 is a medium-saturation purple. On low-quality Android screens (which dominate the Philippine market), purple can shift toward muddy blue or washed-out gray. This needs testing on actual target devices, not just designer monitors and iPhones.
- Lavender reads "feminine" in Filipino cultural context, which may create friction with the stated goal of gender inclusivity.

### 2.2 THE PINK FLAG

**This must be addressed directly.** The concept includes Sunset Blush #F4B8C5 as an accent color. This is pink. Specifically, it is a warm, rosy pink.

If the founder previously stated that pink should be avoided, this needs explicit discussion. The color has been reframed with the name "Sunset Blush" and positioned as an accent rather than a primary, but it is functionally pink. Renaming it does not change how users perceive it. Combined with lavender as the primary color, the overall palette reads as lavender-pink -- which is a deeply feminine combination regardless of intent.

**Recommendation:** If the founder's original instinct to avoid pink was rooted in wanting gender-neutral positioning, that instinct was correct. This palette contradicts that goal. If the concern was specifically about competing with Brideworthy's pink, the accent usage creates less direct collision, but the association remains.

### 2.3 Competitive Color Positioning

| Platform | Primary Color | Personality | Haraya Differentiation |
|----------|--------------|-------------|----------------------|
| Brideworthy | Pink/Magenta | Feminine, traditional bride | Different primary, similar accent territory |
| Kasal.com | Blue | Established, corporate | Strong differentiation |
| Bride and Breakfast | Beige/Neutral | Editorial, aspirational | Strong differentiation |
| eKasal | Blue/White | Directory, functional | Strong differentiation |
| **Haraya** | **Lavender** | **Dreamy, premium** | **Unique in PH market** |

Lavender does create genuine whitespace in the competitive landscape. This is a real advantage.

### 2.4 Inclusivity Concern: Does "Dreamy/Ethereal" Feel Too Feminine?

**Yes, it does.** Here is why this matters:

- The combination of lavender + pink accent + flowing animations + shimmer effects + the word "dreams" creates an overwhelmingly feminine-coded aesthetic.
- For LGBTQ+ couples (particularly gay male couples), this aesthetic may feel exclusionary, not because it is hostile but because it signals "this space was not designed with you in mind."
- For Muslim Filipino weddings, the "dreamy/ethereal" aesthetic may feel disconnected from the solemnity and specific cultural traditions of Nikah ceremonies.
- For budget-conscious couples (a large portion of the PHP 100K-500K market), premium dreaminess may signal "this platform is not for people like us."

The Fiesta concept, by contrast, was inherently more inclusive in its energy. A fiesta is a community celebration that encompasses all genders, all backgrounds, all budget levels.

### 2.5 Cloud White #F7F5FB vs Pure White #FFFFFF

Cloud White #F7F5FB has a very slight lavender tint. In practice:
- On calibrated monitors: barely perceptible but adds warmth
- On typical Android screens: almost certainly indistinguishable from white
- On low-brightness or outdoor viewing: invisible

The tint is a nice designer touch but will not meaningfully impact user experience for the target audience. It is not a problem, but it is also not a differentiator.

---

## 3. TARGET MARKET FIT

### 3.1 Filipino Couples 25-35, Mobile-First, Android on 4G

This is the most critical section because the target audience determines everything.

**Device Reality Check:**
The majority of Filipino couples in this age range use mid-range Android devices (Samsung Galaxy A series, Xiaomi, Realme, Vivo) on 4G connections that vary widely in speed and reliability. This has direct implications for the Haraya design concept:

| Design Element | Haraya Concept | Performance Risk |
|---------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Soft gradients | Background gradients, card fills | Low risk (CSS gradients are efficient) |
| Flowing animations | Page transitions, element reveals | Medium risk (depends on implementation) |
| Shimmer hover effects | Button interactions | Medium-high risk (continuous animation on hover/touch) |
| Lavender-tinted shadows | Card shadows with color | Low risk (standard CSS) |
| Glow on hover | Card interaction states | Medium risk (box-shadow animation) |
| Generous spacing | Large whitespace, padding | Increases scroll depth, more data on image-heavy pages |

The concept is not inherently unworkable on Android 4G, but it requires disciplined implementation. The "shimmer hover effects" and "flowing animations" are the highest-risk elements. If these are implemented as continuous CSS animations or JavaScript-driven effects, they will drain battery, increase CPU usage, and create janky experiences on low-end devices.

**Recommendation:** Any visual concept adopted must be tested on a PHP 8,000-12,000 Android phone on a throttled 4G connection. If the experience degrades, the concept fails where it matters most.

### 3.2 Does "Dreamy Lavender" Resonate with Filipino Millennials/Gen Z?

**Mixed signal.** Filipino Gen Z is highly active on Instagram, TikTok, and Pinterest, where lavender aesthetics do well. The "soft girl" and "coquettecore" aesthetics are popular among younger Filipinas. However:

- The most popular Philippine consumer apps (GCash, Grab, Shopee, Lazada) use bold, saturated colors -- green, orange, red, blue. Filipino digital consumers are accustomed to high-energy, high-contrast interfaces.
- A dreamy lavender interface may feel slow, passive, or low-energy compared to what Filipino users expect from a transactional platform.
- There is a difference between an aesthetic that people admire on Instagram and an aesthetic that people want to USE as a tool. Wedding planning is stressful, time-pressured, and action-oriented. The tool aesthetic needs to support urgency and clarity, not contemplation.

### 3.3 Does the Premium Aesthetic Work for the PHP 100K-1M Market?

**Potentially alienating for the lower end of this range.**

- PHP 100K-300K weddings (a significant portion of the market) involve tight budgets and pragmatic decision-making. A "premium dreamy" platform may signal that the vendors and services listed are expensive.
- PHP 500K-1M weddings are more aspirational and may respond to premium positioning.
- The risk: positioning too premium early on shrinks the addressable market and makes vendor acquisition harder (fewer couples = less value for vendors to list).

The Fiesta concept, with its celebratory energy, was budget-agnostic. A fiesta is a fiesta whether you spend PHP 100K or PHP 1M. "Dreamy" has a class connotation.

### 3.4 Vendor Appeal

Vendors (photographers, caterers, venues, coordinators) are a critical two-sided marketplace stakeholder. They need to feel that the platform will:
1. Drive inquiries (volume)
2. Attract the right clients (quality)
3. Present their work professionally (portfolio showcase)

**Haraya's vendor positioning:**
- Pro: Lavender/premium aesthetic may attract higher-budget couples, which vendors prefer.
- Con: "Dreamy" does not communicate marketplace efficiency. Vendors want to see inquiry counts, analytics, and business tools. A dreamy aesthetic on the vendor dashboard would be actively counterproductive.
- Con: Male-dominated vendor categories (videographers, sound/lighting, transportation) may find the aesthetic off-putting for their professional brand.

**Recommendation:** If Haraya is adopted, the vendor-facing side of the platform should have a distinctly different, more professional aesthetic. The dreaminess should be reserved for the couple-facing experience only.

### 3.5 Muslim Filipino & LGBTQ+ Weddings

**Muslim Filipino Weddings:**
- The dreamy/ethereal aesthetic has no connection to Islamic wedding traditions or Moro cultural aesthetics.
- The lavender-pink palette may feel culturally disconnected.
- This does not make the platform unusable, but it does not signal "we understand your celebration."

**LGBTQ+ Commitment Ceremonies:**
- Same-sex unions are not legally recognized in the Philippines, but Holy Union ceremonies and commitment celebrations do happen.
- 73% of Filipinos now express some acceptance of homosexuality, with higher rates among younger, urban populations.
- The lavender-pink aesthetic, while feminine-coded, does have historical associations with LGBTQ+ culture (the lavender menace, lavender as a queer color). However, this is primarily a Western association and may not translate to Filipino LGBTQ+ couples.
- The bigger issue: Can these couples find vendors who will serve them? The platform's inclusivity is ultimately determined by vendor policies and couple testimonials, not color palette.

## 4. BRAND ARCHITECTURE COMPARISON

| Dimension | everaftr (Fiesta) | Haraya (Dream) | Advantage |
|-----------|------------------|----------------|-----------|
| **Energy** | Vibrant, celebratory, active | Soft, aspirational, contemplative | Fiesta -- wedding planning needs energy |
| **Feeling** | Joy, community, togetherness | Dreams, imagination, vision | Context-dependent |
| **Cultural hook** | Filipino fiesta (universal, visceral) | Filipino word (literary, requires explanation) | Fiesta -- broader recognition |
| **Color energy** | High (coral, blue, gold, green, purple) | Low-medium (lavender, mist, blush) | Fiesta -- better for action-oriented platform |
| **Typography** | Modern sans + serif | Classic serif + geometric sans | Haraya -- more refined |
| **Name uniqueness** | Medium (modified common phrase) | Low (many existing Haraya brands) | everaftr |
| **Domain/SEO** | Likely available, less competition | Contested, high competition | everaftr |
| **Premium feel** | Medium | High | Haraya |
| **Budget inclusivity** | High (fiesta = everyone celebrates) | Medium (dreamy = aspirational price signal) | Fiesta |
| **Gender inclusivity** | High (fiesta is for everyone) | Low-Medium (lavender + pink = feminine) | Fiesta |
| **Instagram aesthetic** | Vibrant, shareable, pattern-rich | Soft, moody, editorial | Haraya -- for a specific audience |
| **Mobile performance** | Bold colors render well on all screens | Subtle tones may wash out on cheap screens | Fiesta |
| **Vendor appeal** | Broad (energy = traffic = inquiries) | Narrow (premium = selective = fewer inquiries) | Fiesta |
| **Emotional depth** | Surface-level joy | Deeper, more layered | Haraya |
| **Sophistication** | Medium | High | Haraya |

## 5. RISKS & CONCERNS

### 5.1 "Dreamy" as Action Friction

This is the single biggest risk. A wedding planning platform must drive users toward concrete actions:
- Search for vendors
- Send inquiries
- Compare prices
- Book services
- Manage guest lists
- Track budgets

Every one of these actions requires clarity, urgency, and decisiveness. A "dreamy" aesthetic works against all of these. Consider:

- Dreamy = slow, contemplative, uncertain
- Planning = fast, organized, decisive

The aesthetic creates cognitive dissonance with the platform's core utility. Users come to dream about their wedding on Pinterest and Instagram. They come to a planning platform to get things done.

### 5.2 Performance on Target Devices

Already addressed in Section 3.1, but worth emphasizing: shimmer animations, gradient fills on buttons, glow effects on card hover, and flowing page transitions will be tested on the lowest common denominator device in your audience. If a Realme C55 on Smart 4G cannot render these smoothly, the concept fails in production regardless of how beautiful it looks in Figma.

### 5.3 Name Saturation

At least 6-8 active Filipino brands use "Haraya" or "Hiraya" in their name. This creates:
- Trademark risk (potential legal challenges)
- Brand confusion (users searching "Haraya" find fashion, coaching, scents)
- SEO cost (competing for your own brand name)
- Social media handle scarcity (likely need @harayaweddings or @harayaph)

### 5.4 Western Platform Similarity

The Haraya concept (lavender, serif typography, generous whitespace, soft gradients, flowing animations) is aesthetically similar to Western wedding platforms like Zola, The Knot's recent redesigns, and Minted. This is not necessarily bad -- it signals quality and modernity. But it risks losing the "distinctly Filipino" positioning that could be the platform's strongest competitive advantage.

Filipino couples already have access to Zola and The Knot. What they do not have is a platform that feels authentically Filipino AND technologically modern. The Fiesta concept addressed this gap more directly.

### 5.5 Loss of Filipino Identity

"Haraya" as a word is Filipino. But the visual identity -- lavender gradients, Playfair Display, flowing infinity symbol, shimmer effects -- is not culturally Filipino. It is culturally "global premium digital." You could apply this exact visual system to a Scandinavian wedding platform, a Japanese stationery brand, or a British wellness app, and it would feel equally at home.

The Fiesta concept, with its coral/blue/gold/green/purple palette, had embedded cultural signals (fiesta colors, celebratory energy, community emphasis) that were visually and emotionally Filipino.

The Haraya concept uses a Filipino word but wraps it in a globally generic visual identity. This is a contradiction: the name says "Filipino imagination" but the design says "international minimalism."

---

## 6. OPPORTUNITIES

### 6.1 What Does Haraya Do BETTER Than Fiesta?

1. **Sophistication:** Haraya feels more polished, refined, and premium. For couples who want a high-end planning experience, this signals quality.

2. **Emotional Depth:** "Dreams taking shape" is a richer narrative than "celebrate together." It positions the platform as a partner in the creative vision, not just a vendor directory.

3. **Photography/Visual Showcase:** The muted lavender palette makes vendor photography pop more than a vibrant coral-blue-gold palette would. This matters for a marketplace where photography is the primary vendor showcase medium.

4. **Social Media Aesthetic:** On Instagram and TikTok, the Haraya aesthetic would produce a more cohesive, editorial feed. The Fiesta palette, while energetic, could look chaotic in a grid format.

5. **Typography:** Playfair Display + Poppins is a genuinely strong typographic pairing. It conveys tradition (serif) meeting modernity (geometric sans) -- a relevant metaphor for Filipino weddings themselves.

### 6.2 Unique Positioning Opportunities

- **"The Anti-Pinterest":** Position Haraya as the platform where dreams become plans. Acknowledge that couples dream on Pinterest but emphasize that Haraya is where those dreams get structured, budgeted, and executed. This reframes "dreamy" from passive to transitional.
- **Premium Tier Strategy:** Haraya's aesthetic naturally supports a premium tier for higher-budget weddings, with a more functional/stripped-down free tier.
- **Content-Led Growth:** The "imagination/vision" brand could support a strong editorial content strategy -- styled shoot features, vendor spotlight stories, trend reports -- that drives organic traffic and positions the platform as a tastemaker.

### 6.3 Social Media Aesthetic Comparison

| Dimension | Fiesta Feed | Haraya Feed |
|-----------|------------|-------------|
| Grid cohesion | Medium (multiple bold colors compete) | High (lavender unifies everything) |
| Photo contrast | Photos may clash with bright brand colors | Photos pop against muted backgrounds |
| Story templates | Energetic, shareable, fun | Elegant, editorial, aspirational |
| Reel aesthetic | Party/celebration vibes | Dreamy/cinematic vibes |
| User-generated content | Easy to produce (bold = forgiving) | Hard to produce (muted = precise styling needed) |

## 7. SCORED VERDICT

### 7.1 Concept Scoring (1-10 Scale)

| Dimension | everaftr (Fiesta) | Haraya (Dream) | Notes |
|-----------|:-----------------:|:--------------:|-------|
| **Memorability** | 7 | 6 | everaftr is instantly understood; Haraya requires explanation and competes with existing brands |
| **Cultural Fit** | 8 | 6 | Fiesta is a universal Filipino concept; Haraya is literary and less broadly known |
| **Market Appeal (25-35)** | 7 | 7 | Fiesta is broadly appealing; Haraya is deeply appealing to a narrower segment |
| **Inclusivity** | 8 | 5 | Fiesta is inherently inclusive; Haraya's lavender-pink aesthetic skews feminine |
| **Differentiation** | 6 | 7 | Both are differentiated, but Haraya's visual identity is more distinctive in the current market |
| **Vendor Appeal** | 7 | 5 | Vendors want traffic and inquiries; Fiesta's energy signals volume; Haraya's premium signals selectivity |
| **Overall** | **43/60** | **36/60** | |

### 7.2 Recommendation

**I recommend everaftr (Fiesta) as the primary brand direction, with selective incorporation of Haraya's strongest elements.**

Here is why:

1. **The name "everaftr" is strategically stronger.** It has fewer namespace conflicts, better SEO prospects, more intuitive global comprehension, and direct wedding relevance. "Haraya" is a beautiful word, but it is a crowded word in the Filipino brand landscape.

2. **The Fiesta concept is more aligned with platform mechanics.** A wedding planning marketplace needs energy, action, and inclusivity. The Fiesta concept delivers all three. The Haraya concept optimizes for aspiration at the expense of utility.

3. **Inclusivity is not optional.** If the platform genuinely intends to serve LGBTQ+ couples, Muslim Filipino celebrations, and budget-conscious weddings alongside premium Manila affairs, the brand must signal openness and warmth. Fiesta does this naturally. Haraya's lavender-pink femininity works against it.

4. **The target device ecosystem demands bold, clear design.** Lavender on cheap Android screens is a real risk. Coral, blue, and gold render reliably across all screens and connection speeds.

### 7.3 The Hybrid Path (Recommended)

The strongest outcome is neither pure Fiesta nor pure Haraya, but a thoughtful combination:

**Keep from everaftr (Fiesta):**
- The name "everaftr" -- it is cleaner, less contested, and more directly relevant
- The celebratory, inclusive energy
- Bold, saturated primary colors that render well on all devices
- Action-oriented tagline direction ("plan together, celebrate forevr" or a refined version)
- The community/togetherness emotional core

**Take from Haraya (Dream):**
- Playfair Display + Poppins typography -- this is a genuinely excellent pairing
- The design philosophy of "generous spacing" and breathing room in layouts
- The editorial content strategy and tastemaker positioning
- The idea of subtle tinted backgrounds (but in warm cream/ivory rather than lavender)
- Card radius and rounded UI elements (20px radius, rounded buttons) for a modern, friendly feel
- The "soft but strong" balance -- apply it to the Fiesta palette to avoid looking like a children's party

**Avoid from both:**
- Shimmer animations (performance risk, no functional value)
- Pink accent in any form (if the founder's instinct was to avoid it, trust that instinct)
- Flowing infinity symbol logo (generic, not culturally specific)
- "Dreamy" as a brand attribute for a transactional platform
- The five-color Fiesta palette at full saturation (needs restraint to avoid visual chaos)

**The Hybrid Vision: "everaftr -- where celebrations come alive"**

A platform that feels like the best Filipino celebration you have ever been to: warm, vibrant, welcoming to everyone, beautifully styled but never pretentious. The typography is refined (Playfair + Poppins). The layout breathes (generous spacing). The colors are joyful but controlled (coral primary, blue secondary, gold accent -- three colors, not five). The energy drives action. The aesthetic works on every device, every connection, every screen.

This is a platform where a couple planning a PHP 150K intimate garden wedding and a couple planning a PHP 800K Manila ballroom affair both feel equally welcome. Where a same-sex couple planning a commitment ceremony sees themselves represented. Where a Muslim Filipino couple finds vendors who understand Nikah traditions. Where a vendor in Cebu sees a pipeline of qualified inquiries, not just an Instagram-pretty interface.

That is the brand that wins the Philippine wedding planning market.

## 8. FINAL NOTES

### If You Proceed with Haraya Despite This Analysis

If the decision is made to move forward with Haraya, these are the minimum adjustments needed:

1. **Verify trademark availability** for "Haraya" in the Philippine wedding/technology category. Given the density of existing brands, this could be a blocking issue.
2. **Secure haraya.ph** immediately, as well as harayaweddings.com and @harayaweddings on all social platforms.
3. **Replace Sunset Blush #F4B8C5** with a gender-neutral accent. Consider a warm amber, sage green, or deep twilight blue instead.
4. **Remove all shimmer and glow animations** from the mobile experience. Reserve them for desktop only, behind a prefers-reduced-motion media query.
5. **Test the entire color palette** on Samsung Galaxy A15, Xiaomi Redmi 13C, and Realme C55 at outdoor brightness levels.
6. **Build a separate, professional vendor dashboard** that does not use the dreamy aesthetic. Vendors need business tools, not brand theater.
7. **Develop a strong onboarding explanation** for the word "haraya" so that every new user understands the brand meaning within 5 seconds of first interaction.

### Questions for the Founder

Before finalizing any direction, these questions need clear answers:

1. Why was the original instinct to avoid pink? Has that reasoning changed, or has the Haraya concept simply repackaged pink under a different name?
2. Who is the primary user: the couple or the vendor? The answer fundamentally shapes which aesthetic serves the platform.
3. What is the year-one growth strategy: breadth (maximum couples and vendors) or depth (premium positioning with fewer, higher-value transactions)? Fiesta supports breadth. Haraya supports depth.
4. Has the founder spoken with actual Filipino couples 25-35 about the word "haraya"? Do they recognize it, connect with it, or need it explained?
5. Is the LGBTQ+ and Muslim Filipino inclusion genuine product strategy, or aspirational marketing? If genuine, the brand must be tested with these communities before launch.
