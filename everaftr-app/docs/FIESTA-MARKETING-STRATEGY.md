## 1. Executive Summary

everaftr is entering a PHP 74B-207B wedding market that serves 370,000-415,000 Filipino couples annually -- yet has no modern, inclusive, mobile-first planning platform. The competitive landscape is fragmented: Facebook groups are chaotic and unstructured, Kasal.com (est. 2001) is dated, Bride & Breakfast is editorial-only with no planning tools, and Brideworthy skews luxury and pink. None of them serve Muslim weddings, commitment ceremonies, or budget-conscious couples with intention.

The Fiesta brand concept positions everaftr as something entirely new: a wedding planning platform that feels unmistakably Filipino, radically inclusive, and community-centered. The fiesta is the Philippines' most universal celebration format. Every barangay has one. Everyone is welcome. Everyone eats. By anchoring the brand in this cultural truth, everaftr transcends the aspirational/luxury positioning that dominates the wedding industry and instead says: your celebration is valid, your love is worthy, and we are here to help you plan it -- together.

This document outlines the complete marketing and branding strategy from pre-launch through the first 12 months, covering brand positioning, architecture, launch sequencing, content strategy, competitive differentiation, campaign concepts, and success metrics.

## 2. Brand Positioning

### 2.1 Positioning Statement

**For** Filipino couples of all backgrounds, budgets, and beliefs **who are** planning their wedding or commitment celebration, **everaftr is** the Philippines' first inclusive, mobile-first wedding planning platform **that** makes wedding planning feel like a fiesta -- joyful, communal, and welcoming to everyone -- **unlike** existing resources that are either unstructured (Facebook groups), outdated (Kasal.com), editorial-only (Bride & Breakfast), or exclusionary in their luxury positioning (Brideworthy).

### 2.2 Brand Promise (One Sentence)

**"Every couple deserves a celebration that feels like home."**

This promise operates on two levels: (1) the literal -- everaftr helps you plan the actual celebration, and (2) the emotional -- it should feel like *your* home, your culture, your kind of love, not someone else's aspirational template.

### 2.3 Emotional Territory

everaftr owns the emotional territory of **"shared joy."**

This is distinct from what competitors occupy:

| Competitor | Emotional Territory |
|---|---|
| Bride & Breakfast | Aspirational beauty ("Look at this wedding") |
| Brideworthy | Luxury achievement ("You deserve the best") |
| Kasal.com | Practical convenience ("We'll handle it") |
| Facebook Groups | Anxious crowdsourcing ("Help, is this vendor legit?") |
| **everaftr** | **Shared joy ("Let's celebrate together")** |

The fiesta frame reinforces this: fiestas are not about one person's perfection. They are about a community coming together to share joy. That energy -- warm, inclusive, a little chaotic in the best way, deeply Filipino -- is what everaftr channels.

### 2.4 Brand Values

These five values map directly to the five fiesta colors:

| Value | Color | Hex | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Saya** (Joy) | Sunset Coral | #E8533F | The warmth and excitement of celebration |
| **Tiwala** (Trust) | Fiesta Blue | #2B6CB0 | Reliability, verified vendors, honest tools |
| **Tagumpay** (Achievement) | Mango Gold | #F5A623 | Milestones reached, plans completed |
| **Pag-asa** (Hope) | Sampaguita Leaf Green | #2D7A3E | New beginnings, growth, a future together |
| **Pagkakaisa** (Unity) | Ube Purple | #7C3F94 | Inclusivity, all celebrations welcome |

### 2.5 Brand Voice & Tone Guidelines

The Fiesta concept directly shapes how everaftr speaks. The voice is the *tita who actually has good taste* -- warm, knowledgeable, encouraging, never condescending, always inclusive.

**Voice Attributes:**

| Attribute | What It Sounds Like | What It Does NOT Sound Like |
|---|---|---|
| **Warm** | "We're so excited you're here." | "Welcome to our platform." |
| **Grounded** | "Let's talk about your actual budget." | "Dream without limits!" |
| **Inclusive** | "All celebrations welcome -- Catholic, civil, Muslim, or your own way." | "Traditional Filipino weddings" (implying one kind) |
| **Community-minded** | "Other couples loved this vendor for..." | "Top-rated luxury supplier" |
| **Playful but not juvenile** | "Ready to plan the best party of your life?" | "OMG your wedding is gonna be LIT" |
| **Filipino-fluent** | Natural Taglish when appropriate. "Tara, let's plan!" | Forced Filipino for branding. Pure English corporate-speak. |

**Tone Shifts by Context:**

- **Onboarding / First-time experience:** Warm, celebratory, excited. "Congratulations! Let's make this happen."
- **Budget tools / Checklists:** Calm, practical, reassuring. "You're on track. Here's what's next."
- **Vendor discovery:** Enthusiastic, trustworthy. "80+ verified vendors, all reviewed by real couples."
- **Emotional moments (ceremony type selection):** Gentle, affirming. "However you celebrate, we're here for it."
- **Error states / Empty states:** Light humor, helpful. "Wala pa dito -- but let's fix that."

**Taglish Guidelines:**

everaftr uses Taglish naturally, the way the target audience (25-35, urban Filipino) actually speaks. Rules:

- Filipino words are never italicized -- they are not foreign words in this context.
- Use Taglish for warmth and personality (CTAs, headers, micro-copy), not for formal/legal content.
- Default to English for long-form content, switching to Filipino/Taglish for emphasis and emotion.
- Never use Filipino as decoration. It should feel earned and natural.

**Sample Copy (Fiesta Voice):**

- Hero headline: "Plan together, celebrate forevr."
- Subheadline: "The Philippines' first wedding platform for every kind of love."
- CTA button: "Tara, let's plan!"
- Vendor card: "Trusted by 24 couples in Cebu"
- Budget tracker: "PHP 142,000 of PHP 200,000 allocated. You're doing great."
- Empty vendor shortlist: "Wala ka pang saved vendors -- browse na!"
- Ceremony type selector: "How are you celebrating? Catholic | Civil | Muslim | Our Own Way"

## 3. Brand Architecture

### 3.1 Brand Hierarchy

The everaftr brand operates in a clear hierarchy. Every touchpoint should be legible even at the smallest screen size (Android, 4G connections).

```
LEVEL 1: WORDMARK
  everaftr (always lowercase, always one word)
  -- Primary identifier
  -- Appears on every screen, every asset
  -- Set in the display serif (TBD: Cormorant Garamond, Playfair, or Fraunces)
  -- The "a" in "aftr" is the icon seed (potential standalone mark)

LEVEL 2: TAGLINE
  plan together, celebrate forevr
  -- Always lowercase
  -- Set in Jost (body font)
  -- Appears in hero contexts, splash screens, social bios, email signatures
  -- Never appears without the wordmark above or beside it

LEVEL 3: BANDERITA ACCENT
  The 5-color segmented line (Coral > Blue > Gold > Green > Purple)
  -- Signature visual element, used as:
    * Dividers between sections
    * Progress indicators
    * Hover/active states on cards
    * Loading animations
    * Social media frame element
  -- This is the most recognizable brand asset after the wordmark
  -- It is NEVER used alone as a logo -- always accompanies wordmark or content

LEVEL 4: COLOR SYSTEM + ICONOGRAPHY
  The 5 fiesta colors in their assigned roles (see Section 3.3)
  -- Icon style: line icons with rounded terminals, 2px stroke
  -- Photography style: natural light, real couples, warm tones, candid > posed

LEVEL 5: TYPOGRAPHIC VOICE
  Display serif (wordmark, headings) + Jost (body, UI)
  -- Serif conveys: tradition, ceremony, importance
  -- Jost conveys: modernity, clarity, accessibility
```

### 3.2 Sub-Brand Strategy

The Fiesta concept should extend to sub-brands, but lightly. Sub-brands should feel like rooms at the same fiesta, not separate parties.

**Recommended Sub-Brand Architecture:**

| Sub-Brand | Role | Naming Approach | Color Accent |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Kasa** (AI Assistant) | Planning companion, smart recommendations | "Kasa" -- from "kasama" (companion). Warm, conversational name. | Fiesta Blue #2B6CB0 (trust) |
| **Vendor Dashboard** | Vendor-facing tools and analytics | "everaftr for Vendors" -- not a separate name. Keep it under the master brand. | Mango Gold #F5A623 (achievement/business) |
| **The Handaan** | Blog/content hub | "Handaan" means feast/celebration. The content table where everyone gathers. | Sampaguita Leaf Green #2D7A3E (growth/learning) |
| **All Celebrations Welcome** | Inclusivity initiative / badge | Not a sub-brand, but a campaign-grade phrase that functions as a commitment badge. | Ube Purple #7C3F94 (unity) |

**Kasa -- Deeper Naming Rationale:**

"Kasa" works on multiple levels:
- Short for "kasama" (companion/partner) -- the AI is your planning companion
- Phonetically close to "casa" (home) -- reinforcing the "feels like home" promise
- Three syllables, easy to say, easy to type in a chat interface
- Distinct from generic AI names (no "assistant," no "bot," no "GPT")

**Kasa Voice (Distinct from Main Brand):**

Kasa speaks like a knowledgeable, organized friend -- slightly more concise than the main brand voice, because it operates in a chat/recommendation context.

- "I found 3 caterers in Quezon City within your budget. Want me to compare them?"
- "Your guest list is at 120. Based on your venue, you might want to cap at 150."
- "Heads up -- your photographer hasn't confirmed yet. Want me to send a follow-up?"

### 3.3 Color Mapping to Brand Touchpoints

Each of the 5 fiesta colors has a primary role in the system. This prevents the palette from becoming chaotic and ensures every color earns its place.

```
SUNSET CORAL #E8533F -- THE ACTION COLOR
  Role: Primary CTA, urgency, celebration moments
  Used for:
    - All primary buttons ("Tara, let's plan!" / "Book Now" / "Save Vendor")
    - Notification badges
    - Achievement celebrations (confetti moments when milestones are hit)
    - Social media: primary accent in templates
  NEVER used for: Error states (use a distinct red), large background fills

FIESTA BLUE #2B6CB0 -- THE TRUST COLOR
  Role: Information, navigation, professional contexts
  Used for:
    - Links and secondary buttons
    - Kasa AI interface elements
    - Vendor verification badges ("Verified on everaftr")
    - Information cards and tooltips
    - Header/nav active states
  NEVER used for: Warning or error contexts

MANGO GOLD #F5A623 -- THE MILESTONE COLOR
  Role: Achievement, progress, vendor/business contexts
  Used for:
    - Progress bars and completion indicators
    - Budget tracker accents
    - Vendor dashboard primary accent
    - Star ratings and review highlights
    - "Featured" or "Popular" badges
  NEVER used for: Warning icons (too close to yellow warning convention on its own)

SAMPAGUITA LEAF GREEN #2D7A3E -- THE GROWTH COLOR
  Role: Success states, new beginnings, content/editorial
  Used for:
    - Success confirmations ("Vendor booked!" / "Budget updated!")
    - The Handaan (blog) section accent
    - Checklist completed items
    - "New" badges for fresh content
    - Environmental/sustainability callouts
  NEVER used for: Financial negative indicators

UBE PURPLE #7C3F94 -- THE INCLUSIVITY COLOR
  Role: Diversity, special features, premium/elevated moments
  Used for:
    - "All Celebrations Welcome" badge and related UI
    - Ceremony type selector accents
    - Premium feature highlights (if freemium model introduced later)
    - Cultural spotlight content
    - Muslim wedding, commitment ceremony, and non-traditional content markers
  NEVER used for: Error or warning states

WHITE CANVAS #FFFFFF / LINEN #FAFAF8 -- THE FOUNDATION
  Role: 70%+ of any page. Breathing room. Lets the fiesta colors sing.
  - #FFFFFF for primary content areas
  - #FAFAF8 for alternate sections, cards on white backgrounds
  - This restraint is critical: fiesta does not mean visual chaos.
    The white canvas is the equivalent of the open plaza where the fiesta happens.
```

### 3.4 The Banderita System -- Usage Rules

The banderita (5-color segmented line) is the signature element. Rules for deployment:

**Structure:**
- Always uses all 5 colors in order: Coral > Blue > Gold > Green > Purple
- Segments are equal width
- Minimum height: 3px (mobile), 4px (desktop)
- Maximum height: 8px (hero sections, feature dividers)
- Corner radius: 2px on outer ends, 0px on inner joints

**Applications:**
- Page section dividers (horizontal)
- Card hover states (bottom border animates from left to right)
- Progress bars (fills color-by-color as planning progresses, each color representing a planning phase)
- Loading animation (segments pulse sequentially)
- Social media templates (top or bottom frame)
- Email header/footer element
- Physical collateral (business cards, stickers, booth signage)

**Do NOT:**
- Use the banderita vertically (it references the horizontal bunting of a fiesta)
- Use it as a background pattern
- Animate it in a way that feels like a loading error
- Use fewer than all 5 colors
- Alter the color order

```

### 4.2 Phase 0 -- Foundation (February -- March 2026)

**Building Anticipation with Zero Users:**

The challenge: you have no users, no social proof, no weddings to showcase. The strategy: build the *brand* before the product is public. Make people feel something before they can use anything.

**4.2.1 Brand Asset Creation (Weeks 1-3)**

Deliverables:
- Finalized wordmark with chosen serif (recommendation: Fraunces for its warmth, optical sizing, and distinctly non-corporate character)
- Banderita design system formalized in Figma
- Social media templates (Instagram grid, Stories, Reels covers, TikTok overlays, Facebook covers)
- Email signature and newsletter template
- Brand photography brief (for first shoot with real couples -- see below)
- Vendor pitch deck (PDF, 10 slides max)
- "Coming Soon" landing page with email capture

**4.2.2 Social Media Seeding (Weeks 2-8)**

Launch social accounts and begin posting BEFORE the product is available. The content should build the *world* of everaftr -- the fiesta ethos, the inclusivity promise, the Filipino wedding culture -- without hard-selling a product nobody can use yet.

**Instagram Strategy (Primary Visual Platform):**

- Account name: @everaftr.ph
- Bio: "plan together, celebrate forevr. The Philippines' first inclusive wedding platform. All Celebrations Welcome. Coming soon."
- Grid strategy: Alternate between 3 content types in a 3-column grid pattern

```
Column 1: Cultural content (warm photography, Filipino wedding traditions)
Column 2: Brand storytelling (the fiesta colors, behind-the-scenes, mission)
Column 3: Community content (couple stories, vendor spotlights, questions)
```

- Post frequency: 4x/week (Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Sunday)
- Stories: Daily -- polls, "this or that" wedding choices, vendor teasers
- Reels: 2x/week -- short, high-energy, Taglish

**Pre-Launch Instagram Content Ideas (30 posts):**

1. Brand reveal post -- wordmark on white with banderita. "We're building something new."
2. "Why fiesta?" -- carousel explaining the brand concept
3. "All Celebrations Welcome" -- graphic with the 4 ceremony types
4. Real couple portrait (first photoshoot) -- Catholic wedding
5. Color story -- "Meet Sunset Coral" with the value "Saya"
6. "Did you know?" -- Filipino wedding tradition (arras)
7. Real couple portrait -- civil wedding
8. Color story -- "Meet Fiesta Blue" with the value "Tiwala"
9. Poll: "What's your dream wedding venue?" with 4 options
10. Behind the scenes: building the platform (dev screenshots, wireframes)
11. Real couple portrait -- Muslim wedding
12. Color story -- "Meet Mango Gold" with the value "Tagumpay"
13. "Tag your forever person" -- engagement-bait with genuine warmth
14. Vendor spotlight: first featured vendor (photographer)
15. Color story -- "Meet Sampaguita Leaf Green" with the value "Pag-asa"
16. Budget reality: "Average Filipino wedding cost in 2026" (infographic)
17. Real couple portrait -- commitment ceremony
18. Color story -- "Meet Ube Purple" with the value "Pagkakaisa"
19. "Planning a wedding? Here's what we wish someone told us." -- carousel tips
20. Vendor spotlight: caterer
21. "The banderita" -- explaining the visual identity, its cultural roots
22. Couple Q&A: "How did you know they were the one?"
23. Vendor spotlight: venue
24. "Tara, let's plan!" -- Waitlist CTA post
25. Filipino wedding food traditions carousel
26. Couple: interfaith love story
27. Vendor spotlight: MUA
28. Platform sneak peek: 15-second screen recording
29. "We're almost ready" -- countdown post
30. Waitlist milestone: "500 couples are waiting. Are you?"

**TikTok Strategy:**

- Account name: @everaftr.ph
- Content pillars: wedding planning tips (practical), Filipino wedding culture (educational), behind-the-scenes (relatable), couple stories (emotional)
- Frequency: 3-4x/week
- Format: 30-60 second vertical video, native TikTok aesthetic (not polished ads)
- Audio strategy: Use trending Filipino sounds, original audio for recurring series

**TikTok Series Concepts:**

- "Magkano Talaga?" -- real budget breakdowns for different wedding styles
- "All Celebrations Welcome" -- 60-second stories of different ceremony types
- "Vendor Check" -- quick tours of vendor setups/behind-the-scenes
- "Planning Diaries" -- following real couples through their planning journey
- "Fiesta Facts" -- bite-sized Filipino wedding tradition explainers

**Facebook Strategy:**

- Page name: everaftr
- Role: Community building, longer-form content, event promotion, older demographic reach (parents of couples)
- Group: "everaftr Community -- Filipino Wedding Planning" -- this directly competes with unstructured Facebook groups by offering a curated, moderated space
- Frequency: 3x/week on page, daily engagement in group
- Key tactic: Share the same long-form content from the blog, but also engage in *other* wedding Facebook groups to build awareness (not spamming -- genuinely helping, with the everaftr tag in bio)

**4.2.3 Waitlist / Email Capture**

"Coming Soon" landing page elements:
- Hero: wordmark + tagline + banderita
- Subheadline: "The Philippines' first wedding platform for every kind of love."
- Email capture: "Be the first to plan. Join the waitlist."
- Social proof: "Join [number] couples already waiting"
- Inclusivity signal: ceremony type icons (church, courthouse, mosque, heart)
- Mobile-optimized: loads in under 3 seconds on 4G

**Waitlist Incentive:** "First 500 couples get lifetime free access to premium planning tools." This creates urgency and rewards early adopters.

**Email Nurture Sequence (Post-Signup):**

1. Immediate: Welcome email with brand story. "You're part of something new."
2. Day 3: "Why we built everaftr" -- founder story, mission, inclusivity promise
3. Day 7: "Meet Kasa" -- preview of the AI planning assistant
4. Day 14: Vendor spotlight -- "We're already partnering with amazing vendors"
5. Day 21: "Your planning checklist starts here" -- downloadable PDF
6. Day 28: "We're getting close" -- launch timeline, referral ask
7. Launch day: "We're live. Tara, let's plan!"

### 4.3 Vendor Acquisition Strategy -- The First 100 Vendors

Vendors are the supply side of the marketplace. Without them, couples have nothing to discover. The target: 100 vendors before soft launch, 200 before public launch.

**4.3.1 Vendor Segmentation**

Prioritize vendors by category importance (what couples search for first):

```
TIER 1 (Must-have, acquire first):
  - Venues (25 target)
  - Photographers/Videographers (20 target)
  - Caterers (15 target)

TIER 2 (High-value, acquire second):
  - Hair & Makeup Artists (10 target)
  - Wedding Coordinators/Planners (10 target)
  - Florists & Stylists (10 target)

TIER 3 (Long-tail, acquire over time):
  - Wedding cake/desserts (5 target)
  - Bridal attire (5 target)
  - Musicians/DJs/entertainment (5 target)
  - Invitations/stationery (5 target)
```

**4.3.2 Geographic Prioritization**

```
Phase 1: Metro Manila (60% of vendors) -- largest market, most digital-ready
Phase 2: Cebu (20%) -- second largest wedding market
Phase 3: Davao, Iloilo, Pampanga (20%) -- regional expansion
```

**4.3.3 Vendor Outreach Strategy**

**Direct Outreach (Primary -- 60% of first 100):**

- Source vendor lists from Instagram (search #WeddingSupplierPH, #WeddingVendorManila, etc.)
- Source from existing platforms (Kasal.com, Brideworthy, Google Maps listings)
- Personalized email/DM with the vendor pitch deck
- Pitch: "Be a founding vendor on the Philippines' first inclusive wedding platform. Free listing for life. Early adopters get priority placement and a 'Founding Vendor' badge."

**Vendor Pitch Deck (10 Slides):**

1. Cover: everaftr wordmark + "For Vendors"
2. The Problem: "Filipino couples are planning weddings on Facebook Messenger threads. Vendors are invisible unless they pay for ads."
3. The Opportunity: "370,000+ weddings/year. PHP 74-207B market. No modern platform."
4. The Solution: "everaftr -- the first inclusive, mobile-first wedding planning platform."
5. How It Works for Vendors: profile, portfolio, reviews, booking requests, analytics
6. The Brand: fiesta concept, inclusivity promise, target demographic
7. Why Now: rising mobile-first planning, post-pandemic wedding boom, digital shift
8. Founding Vendor Benefits: free lifetime listing, priority placement, founding badge, early analytics access
9. Traction: waitlist numbers, social followers, media mentions (update as they grow)
10. CTA: "Join as a Founding Vendor" + QR code to signup

**Wedding Fair Outreach (Secondary -- 25% of first 100):**

Target these 2026 events for vendor networking:

| Event | Date | Location | Opportunity |
|---|---|---|---|
| The Wedding Library's Bridal Fair | Feb 13-15, 2026 | World Trade Center, Pasay | 350+ vendors under one roof |
| Getting Married Bridal Fair | May 23-24, 2026 | SMX Convention Center, Pasay | Direct vendor sign-ups |
| Wedding Expo Philippines 46th Edition | Mar 28-29, 2026 | SMX MOA | 300+ exhibitors |
| Getting Married Bridal Fair (Jul) | Jul 18-19, 2026 | SMX Convention Center, Pasay | Growth-phase vendor push |
| Kasalan National Wedding Tourism Roadshow | Various 2026 | Cebu, Davao, South Luzon | Regional vendor acquisition |

**Strategy at fairs:** Attend as a visitor (budget-friendly), not an exhibitor (expensive). Walk the floor, collect vendor cards, have conversations, follow up within 48 hours with a personalized email + pitch deck. Offer to feature them in social content.

**Referral Program (Tertiary -- 15% of first 100):**

Once the first 30-40 vendors are onboard, activate referrals:
- "Refer another vendor, both get 'Featured Vendor' placement for 1 month"
- Vendors know other vendors. The wedding industry is deeply networked.

### 4.4 Couple Acquisition Strategy -- The First 1,000 Couples

**4.4.1 Channel Strategy**

```
PRIMARY CHANNELS (70% of acquisition):
  1. Instagram (35%) -- visual discovery, Reels virality
  2. TikTok (20%) -- algorithm-driven reach, younger demographic
  3. Facebook Groups (15%) -- direct engagement with actively-planning couples

SECONDARY CHANNELS (20% of acquisition):
  4. Google Search / SEO (10%) -- intent-based, long-tail keywords
  5. Referral / Word-of-mouth (10%) -- waitlist referral program

TERTIARY CHANNELS (10% of acquisition):
  6. Wedding fair presence (5%)
  7. Partnerships (5%) -- bridal shops, churches, LGUs
```

**4.4.2 Waitlist Referral Program**

"Share everaftr with another couple. When they join the waitlist, you both move up in line and unlock early access."

Mechanics:
- Every waitlist signup gets a unique referral link
- Each successful referral = priority access + premium features unlock
- Leaderboard: top referrers get "Founding Couple" status
- Target: each couple refers 1.5 couples (viral coefficient > 1.0)

**4.4.3 Facebook Group Infiltration (Ethical)**

The biggest competitor is unstructured Facebook groups. Strategy:

1. Identify the top 20 Filipino wedding planning Facebook groups (e.g., "Weddings PH," "Budget Wedding Philippines," "Kasal 2026," "Ikakasal Na Ako")
2. Join as the everaftr brand account AND as the founder personally
3. Be genuinely helpful. Answer questions. Share vendor recommendations. Post planning tips.
4. When relevant (and allowed by group rules), share everaftr content
5. Goal: become a recognized, trusted voice in these communities BEFORE launching
6. Post-launch: these become direct acquisition channels ("Hey, we built the tool for this!")

**4.4.4 Partnership Acquisition (The "Fiesta Network")**

Partnerships that put everaftr in front of couples at the moment they need it:

| Partner Type | Examples | What They Get | What everaftr Gets |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Churches/Parishes** | Major Manila churches with high wedding volume | Free "wedding planning resource" flyers for couples doing pre-Cana | Access to newly-engaged couples at the moment of commitment |
| **LGU Civil Wedding Offices** | Quezon City Hall, Manila City Hall, Cebu City Hall | Digital planning resource for civil ceremony couples | Access to civil wedding couples (43% of all weddings) |
| **Mosques** | Major mosques in Metro Manila, Cotabato, Marawi | First-ever planning resource that explicitly supports Muslim weddings | Access to underserved Muslim couples, credibility signal |
| **Bridal Shops** | David's Bridal PH, local ateliers | Co-marketing, featured placement on everaftr | In-store referrals, QR codes to everaftr |
| **Jewelry Stores** | Local engagement ring retailers | Co-marketing partnership | Capture couples at the engagement moment (earliest funnel) |
| **Hotels/Resorts** | Wedding-friendly venues | Premium listing, analytics | Built-in venue content, co-branded content |

### 4.5 Phase 1 -- Soft Launch (April -- June 2026)

**Invite-Only Beta:**

- Open to first 50 couples from waitlist (prioritize diversity: different ceremony types, budgets, locations)
- Personal onboarding call/chat with each couple
- Weekly feedback collection (short survey + open channel via Messenger or WhatsApp)
- Fix, iterate, fix, iterate

**Vendor Onboarding Sprint:**

- Personal onboarding for each vendor (help them build their profile, upload portfolio)
- "Founding Vendor" badge goes live
- Vendor success stories begin: "Meet [Vendor Name], a founding vendor on everaftr"

**Content Shift:**

- Social content now includes real platform screenshots, real couple usage
- "Beta Diaries" series: following beta couples through their planning
- Vendor spotlights become richer (video tours, behind-the-scenes)

### 4.6 Phase 2 -- Public Launch (July 2026)

**Why July:**

- Post-peak wedding season (January-May) means couples are *starting* to plan for 2027 weddings
- June is the "just got engaged" season (many Filipino proposals happen around Valentine's through June)
- Aligns with mid-year media cycles (less competition for press coverage)
- 5 months of brand-building and beta testing provides foundation

**Launch Week Activation:**

- Day 1 (Monday): Social media announcement across all platforms. Email blast to full waitlist.
- Day 2: PR push -- media kit sent to Rappler, Inquirer Lifestyle, Manila Bulletin Lifestyle, ABS-CBN Digital, wedding blogs
- Day 3: Influencer posts go live (staggered throughout the day)
- Day 4: "All Celebrations Welcome" campaign video release
- Day 5: First "Fiesta Friday" (recurring content moment -- see Campaigns section)
- Day 6-7: Weekend engagement push, retargeting ads for waitlist non-converters

## 5. Content Marketing

### 5.1 Content Pillar Strategy

All content ladders up to one of 5 pillars, each mapped to a fiesta color and brand value:

```
PILLAR 1: PRACTICAL PLANNING (Coral -- Saya/Joy in doing it together)
  Purpose: Help couples actually plan their wedding
  Content types: Checklists, budget guides, timelines, how-tos
  SEO value: High -- captures intent-based searches
  Frequency: 2 articles/week
  Examples:
    - "The Complete Filipino Wedding Planning Checklist (2026)"
    - "How Much Does a Wedding in Metro Manila Really Cost?"
    - "12-Month Wedding Planning Timeline for Filipino Couples"
    - "Civil Wedding Requirements: A City-by-City Guide"

## 6. Competitive Differentiation

### 6.1 Head-to-Head Competitor Analysis

#### Facebook Groups

| Dimension | Facebook Groups | everaftr |
|---|---|---|
| **Structure** | Chaotic. Posts get buried. No organization. | Organized by vendor category, checklist, timeline |
| **Vendor Discovery** | Scroll through posts, hope for the best. No verification. | Curated directory with profiles, portfolios, reviews, verification |
| **Trust** | Anonymous recommendations, potential for fake reviews, vendor self-promotion | Verified vendors, authentic couple reviews, transparent pricing |
| **Planning Tools** | None. Couples track everything in spreadsheets or notebooks. | Budget tracker, checklist, timeline, guest list, vendor shortlist |
| **Inclusivity** | Depends on the specific group's culture. Many are Catholic-centric. | Explicitly inclusive: Catholic, civil, Muslim, commitment ceremonies |
| **Mobile Experience** | Facebook app (not optimized for wedding planning) | Purpose-built mobile-first experience |
| **Data Privacy** | Wedding plans are public or semi-public in group posts | Private. Your wedding data is yours. |

**How the Fiesta brand wins against Facebook groups:** The fiesta metaphor directly addresses the core problem with Facebook groups -- they feel like a disorganized marketplace, not a celebration. everaftr says: "Come to the fiesta. Everything is set up. The vendors are here. The music is playing. You just show up and enjoy." The brand transforms wedding planning from anxious crowdsourcing into joyful, organized community.

#### Kasal.com

| Dimension | Kasal.com | everaftr |
|---|---|---|
| **Founded** | 2001 (25 years old) | 2026 |
| **Design** | Dated, desktop-first, cluttered layout | Modern, mobile-first, clean design |
| **Brand** | Generic "wedding resource" | Fiesta -- unmistakably Filipino, culturally grounded |
| **Vendor Model** | Package-based, commission structure | Vendor profiles + direct booking, no commission |
| **Planning Tools** | Minimal -- mostly a directory and blog | Full suite: budget, checklist, timeline, AI assistant |
| **Inclusivity** | Primarily Catholic/civil | All celebrations: Catholic, civil, Muslim, commitment |
| **Mobile** | Responsive but not mobile-first | Built for Android, optimized for 4G |
| **AI** | None | Kasa AI planning assistant |
| **Community** | Newsletter, privilege card | Active social community, content hub |

**Kasal.com's strength:** Brand recognition (25 years), large existing vendor network, wedding fair presence (Kasalan roadshow). **everaftr's advantage:** Technology, design, inclusivity, mobile experience, AI, brand energy.

#### Bride & Breakfast

| Dimension | Bride & Breakfast | everaftr |
|---|---|---|
| **Model** | Editorial/media company (blog, social) | Planning platform with editorial content |
| **Revenue** | Advertising, sponsored content, events | Vendor subscriptions, premium tools (future) |
| **Content** | Aspirational, luxury-leaning, beautiful photography | Practical + aspirational, all budget levels |
| **Planning Tools** | None (they are an editorial site) | Full planning suite |
| **Social Following** | 228K Instagram followers | Starting from zero |
| **Vendor Relationship** | Advertising clients | Listed partners with profiles and direct booking |
| **Inclusivity** | General (primarily Catholic/civil weddings featured) | Explicit inclusivity across all ceremony types |

**Bride & Breakfast's strength:** Massive content library, established audience, beautiful brand, 228K Instagram. **everaftr's advantage:** Utility (you can actually plan your wedding, not just dream about it), inclusivity, technology, vendor tools.

**Strategic Note:** Bride & Breakfast is not a direct competitor in the functional sense -- they do not offer planning tools. However, they compete for attention and influence. The strategy is to co-exist: everaftr as the planning tool, Bride & Breakfast as the editorial inspiration. Long-term, everaftr's "The Handaan" blog can compete for editorial mindshare.

#### Brideworthy

| Dimension | Brideworthy | everaftr |
|---|---|---|
| **Visual Identity** | Pink, luxury, feminine | Fiesta colors -- inclusive, vibrant, gender-neutral |
| **Target** | Higher-budget couples, bridal-focused | All budgets, all celebration types |
| **Name** | "Bride" -- inherently gendered | "everaftr" -- gender-neutral, couple-focused |
| **Vendor Model** | No commission, lead management for vendors | Similar no-commission model, but with richer tools |
| **Planning Tools** | Basic inquiry system | Full planning suite with AI |
| **Inclusivity** | Standard (implicitly heteronormative, luxury-coded) | Explicitly inclusive |
| **Mobile** | Responsive | Mobile-first |

**Brideworthy's strength:** Clean design, no-commission model, 360-degree venue views. **everaftr's advantage:** Inclusivity (name, design, and features), broader market appeal, AI tools, cultural grounding.

### 6.2 What everaftr Does That No One Else Does

These are not incremental improvements. These are category-defining differentiators.

**1. Explicitly Supports Muslim Weddings**

No Filipino wedding platform has dedicated content, vendor filters, or planning tools for Muslim weddings (nikah, walimah, halal catering, mosque venues). In a country with ~6 million Muslims and a rich tradition of Islamic wedding celebrations, this is a massive gap. everaftr fills it on day one.

**2. Supports Commitment Ceremonies**

Before legal frameworks fully recognize all forms of partnership, everaftr creates space for couples who want to celebrate their commitment. "Our Own Way" as a ceremony type is a statement. No competitor makes this space.

**3. AI-Powered Planning Assistant (Kasa)**

No Filipino wedding platform has an AI assistant. Kasa can recommend vendors based on budget and location, generate timelines, answer planning questions, and learn from couple preferences. This is a genuine technology moat.

**4. Mobile-First for Android on 4G**

Every competitor was designed desktop-first and adapted for mobile. everaftr is designed mobile-first for Android (the dominant device in the Philippines) on 4G connections (the reality for most Filipino users outside Metro Manila). This is not just responsive design -- it is a fundamentally different architectural decision.

**5. Culturally-Grounded Brand (Not Just "Filipino-Themed")**

The fiesta concept is not a decorative layer. It informs the information architecture (community-centered, not luxury-centered), the voice (warm, inclusive, Taglish-natural), and the visual identity (vibrant but restrained, celebratory but grounded). No competitor has this depth of cultural integration.

### 6.3 Competitive Positioning Map

```
                    MODERN TECHNOLOGY

                  LEGACY TECHNOLOGY

                    (Inclusive = serves all ceremony types, budgets, genders)
                    (Exclusive = luxury-coded, limited ceremony types, gendered)
```

everaftr is the only player in the upper-left quadrant: modern technology AND inclusive positioning. This is the strategic whitespace.

## 7. Campaign Ideas

### 7.1 Campaign 1: "All Celebrations Welcome" (Pre-Launch / Ongoing)

**Concept:** A visual and narrative campaign that showcases the diversity of Filipino celebrations. Four couples. Four ceremony types. One platform. One message: all celebrations are welcome here.

**Execution:**

- Commission a portrait photoshoot with four real couples:
  - A Catholic church wedding couple
  - A civil ceremony couple (city hall)
  - A Muslim nikah couple
  - A commitment ceremony couple
- Each portrait uses the same composition (full-body, eye contact, warm light) to create visual equality
- The 5 fiesta colors appear subtly in each couple's styling or environment
- Banderita accent runs across the bottom of every image

**Deliverables:**
- 4 individual portrait posts (Instagram, Facebook)
- 1 carousel combining all four with the message "All Celebrations Welcome"
- 1 short-form video (60 sec) for TikTok and Reels: couples sharing one sentence about what their celebration means to them
- 1 long-form video (2-3 min) for YouTube and Facebook: deeper interviews with each couple
- Campaign landing page with the four stories
- Print version for wedding fair banners

**Hashtag:** #AllCelebrationsWelcome

**Why It Works:** No competitor can run this campaign. It immediately positions everaftr as the inclusive option and generates press/social conversation. It is also inherently shareable -- people want to support and amplify messages of inclusion.

### 7.2 Campaign 2: "Fiesta Friday" (Recurring Weekly Moment)

**Concept:** Every Friday, everaftr celebrates. A recurring social media moment that builds brand ritual and community engagement.

**Execution:**

- Every Friday, one "celebration" post goes live across all platforms
- Rotating format:
  - Week 1: Real couple feature ("This week's Fiesta Friday couple: [Names]!")
  - Week 2: Vendor celebration ("Cheers to [Vendor Name] for 50 bookings on everaftr!")
  - Week 3: Community milestone ("We just hit [X] couples on the platform!")
  - Week 4: Cultural celebration ("This Fiesta Friday, we're celebrating [tradition/region]")
- Visual: Each Fiesta Friday post uses a consistent template with the banderita accent and a warm, celebratory tone
- Engagement hook: "Tag someone who deserves a Fiesta Friday shoutout!"

**Hashtag:** #FiestaFriday

**Why It Works:** Creates a weekly touchpoint that trains the audience to expect and look forward to everaftr content. Builds community through celebration rather than promotion. "Fiesta Friday" is a natural, memorable phrase that reinforces the brand concept.

### 7.3 Campaign 3: "Magkano Talaga?" (Budget Transparency Campaign)

**Concept:** A content series and campaign that breaks the taboo of talking about wedding costs in the Philippines. Real numbers. Real budgets. Real talk.

**Execution:**

- Series of content pieces (blog + social) that reveal actual wedding costs:
  - "We planned a wedding for PHP 80,000. Here's exactly how."
  - "PHP 200K vs. PHP 500K vs. PHP 1M: What do you actually get?"
  - "The 5 hidden costs every Filipino couple forgets"
  - "How 10 real couples spent their wedding budget" (infographic)
- Interactive budget calculator tool on everaftr (great for SEO: "wedding budget calculator Philippines")
- TikTok series: "Magkano ang kasal namin?" -- real couples revealing their actual spend

**Hashtag:** #MagkanoTalaga

**Why It Works:** Filipino couples are desperate for real budget information but embarrassed to ask. Every wedding planning Facebook group is flooded with "Magkano po?" posts. By owning this conversation, everaftr becomes the trusted source of financial truth. This also naturally drives traffic to the platform's budget tools.

### 7.4 Campaign 4: "Tara, Kasama Kita" (Launch Campaign)

**Concept:** The public launch campaign built around the idea that with everaftr, you are never alone in planning. "Kasama" (companion) ties directly to the Kasa AI assistant and the fiesta ethos of togetherness.

**Execution:**

- Hero video (60 seconds): A couple sitting across from each other, overwhelmed by wedding planning chaos (papers, screenshots, Messenger threads). Then Kasa appears (represented by the Fiesta Blue glow on their phone). The chaos resolves. The banderita line animates across the screen. Tagline: "Tara, kasama kita. Plan together, celebrate forevr."
- Social takeover: All platforms change bios to "Tara, kasama kita" for launch week
- OOH (Out-of-Home) if budget allows: MRT/LRT digital ads in Metro Manila showing the video loop
- Radio: 15-second spot on popular Manila stations during morning commute
- Activation: "Plan Your Wedding in 15 Minutes" challenge -- couples use the platform to set up their basic plan in 15 minutes, share their screen recording, tag @everaftr.ph

**Hashtag:** #TaraKasamaKita

**Why It Works:** "Tara" is one of the most universally Filipino invitations -- casual, warm, action-oriented. "Kasama kita" (I'm with you) is emotionally resonant for couples who feel alone in the planning process. The campaign bridges the emotional (you're not alone) with the functional (here's the tool).

### 7.5 Campaign 5: "Handaan ng Bayan" (Community Celebration -- Post-Launch)

**Concept:** A real-world activation that brings the fiesta brand to life. everaftr sponsors or co-hosts a community celebration event -- not a wedding fair, but a *fiesta* for engaged couples.

**Execution:**

- Partner with a venue in Metro Manila for a free, open-to-the-public "engaged couples fiesta"
- Vendors set up booths (food, florals, photography) -- live demonstrations, tastings, mini-consultations
- Cultural performances: different wedding traditions showcased live (Catholic ceremony elements, Muslim wedding music, cord ceremony demonstration)
- Photo wall with banderita backdrop (Instagram-friendly)
- Kasa AI demo station (couples try the AI assistant live)
- Live entertainment, food, drinks -- it should *feel like a fiesta*
- Entry: free, but register on everaftr to RSVP
- Capture: every attendee becomes a registered user

**Hashtag:** #HandaanNgBayan

**Why It Works:** This is the brand made physical. It generates content (photos, videos, stories), vendor relationships, user signups, and press coverage all in one event. It also proves the brand promise -- this IS a fiesta, and everyone IS welcome.

### 7.6 Hashtag Strategy (Complete)

**Primary Brand Hashtags:**
- #everaftr -- master brand tag, used on everything
- #PlanTogetherCelebrateForevr -- tagline tag, aspirational
- #AllCelebrationsWelcome -- inclusivity statement, campaign-grade

**Campaign Hashtags:**
- #FiestaFriday -- weekly recurring
- #MagkanoTalaga -- budget content
- #TaraKasamaKita -- launch campaign
- #HandaanNgBayan -- community event
- #MyEveraftrStory -- UGC, couple stories

**Category Hashtags (used alongside brand tags):**
- #WeddingPH
- #KasalPH
- #FilipinoWedding
- #PHWeddingSupplier
- #WeddingPlanning
- #BudgetWeddingPH
- #MuslimWeddingPH
- #CivilWeddingPH

**Usage Rules:**
- Every post uses #everaftr + 1 campaign/category hashtag + 3-5 relevant community hashtags
- Never more than 10 hashtags per Instagram post (algorithm optimization)
- TikTok: 3-5 hashtags maximum (content > tags)
- Facebook: 1-2 hashtags maximum (less hashtag-driven platform)

### 7.7 Influencer & Creator Strategy

**Tier 1: Macro Influencers (100K-1M followers) -- 2-3 partnerships**

Role: Launch awareness, reach, credibility
Investment: PHP 50,000-150,000 per post/campaign
Target profiles:
- Lifestyle creators who have recently gotten engaged or married
- Filipino couple accounts with wedding content
- Not exclusively "wedding influencers" -- lifestyle and culture creators who bring authenticity

Deliverable: 1 Reel/TikTok + 1 Story sequence per creator, featuring the platform, with authentic voiceover

**Tier 2: Micro Influencers (10K-100K followers) -- 10-15 partnerships**

Role: Targeted reach, community trust, niche audiences
Investment: PHP 5,000-25,000 per post/campaign OR product exchange (free premium features)
Target profiles:
- Engaged couples documenting their planning journey
- Regional creators (Cebu, Davao, Iloilo) for geographic expansion
- Muslim lifestyle creators for inclusivity reach
- Budget/practical lifestyle creators for the "Magkano Talaga" campaign

Deliverable: 1-2 organic-feeling posts per creator over 1 month

**Tier 3: Nano Influencers & Real Couples (1K-10K followers) -- 30-50 partnerships**

Role: Authenticity, UGC generation, word-of-mouth
Investment: Free premium features + "Founding Couple" badge
Target profiles:
- Any engaged couple willing to share their planning journey on everaftr
- Wedding vendors who are also content creators
- Wedding planning enthusiasts

Deliverable: Organic content using #MyEveraftrStory

**Vendor-as-Influencer Strategy:**

Wedding vendors already create content (portfolio showcases, behind-the-scenes, setup videos). If 80+ vendors share their everaftr profile, that is 80+ pieces of organic content reaching vendor audiences. Incentivize this:
- "Share your everaftr profile on Instagram, get featured on our page"
- Vendor content kit: branded templates, suggested captions, profile QR code

### 7.8 Offline Marketing

**Wedding Fair Presence:**

Until budget allows for a full booth, attend as a "guerrilla" presence:

- Distribute stickers with the everaftr wordmark + banderita (low cost, high visibility)
- Business cards with QR code to download/signup
- Branded tote bags (useful at fairs -- couples collect tons of materials)
- Branded phone grip/pop socket (mobile-first brand = phone accessory = walking billboard)

When budget allows for a booth (target: July-September 2026):

- Booth design: white canvas + banderita bunting + warm lighting (the fiesta in physical form)
- Interactive: QR code to sign up on the spot, get a free planning consultation with Kasa
- Giveaway: "Plan Your Fiesta" starter kit (everaftr notebook, pen, sticker sheet in the 5 colors)
- Vendor matchmaking: "Tell us your budget and style, we'll match you with 3 vendors in 60 seconds"

**Bridal Shop Partnerships:**

- Place branded materials (postcards, stickers) at partner bridal shops
- Co-branded content: "Found your dress? Now plan the rest on everaftr."
- QR code tent cards at fitting rooms (couples are emotional and planning-minded in these moments)

**Church & LGU Partnerships:**

- Provide free "Wedding Planning Guide" booklets that subtly promote everaftr
- Partner with pre-Cana seminar organizers: include everaftr in resource materials
- Civil wedding offices: place "Plan Your Celebration" postcards at registration desks

### Appendix E: Risk Register

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| "Fiesta" concept perceived as too casual for weddings | Medium | High | Pair fiesta warmth with polished design execution. The serif typography and white-canvas restraint signal sophistication. Test messaging with focus groups before launch. |
| Difficulty acquiring first vendors without user base | High | High | Lead with "Founding Vendor" benefits (free, priority placement, badge). Show waitlist numbers as demand signal. Personal outreach + wedding fair networking. |
| Low organic reach on social media (algorithm challenges) | High | Medium | Invest in Reels/TikTok (algorithm favors video). Paid amplification budget. Community building in Facebook groups. SEO as long-term organic channel. |
| Kasal.com or Brideworthy copies inclusivity positioning | Medium | Medium | First-mover advantage in inclusivity. Build the actual product features (Muslim wedding tools, commitment ceremony support) that back up the brand promise. Positioning is easy to copy; product is harder. |
| Budget constraints limit campaign execution | High | Medium | Prioritize high-ROI activities: organic social, SEO, vendor referrals, Facebook group presence. Delay paid advertising until product-market fit is validated. |
| "All Celebrations Welcome" generates controversy | Low | Medium | Prepare a calm, values-driven response. Do not engage in culture wars. Let the product and community speak. Focus on the affirmative ("we welcome everyone") rather than the oppositional. |
| Slow couple acquisition post-launch | Medium | High | Double down on "Magkano Talaga" practical content (proven demand). Activate vendor-as-channel strategy. Referral incentives. Paid social with strong CTA. |

## Final Note

The Fiesta brand concept is not a theme. It is a strategic position. It answers the question every Filipino couple unconsciously asks when they start planning: "Is this for someone like me?"

The luxury wedding industry says: "This is for someone with more money than you."
The generic platforms say: "This is for a generic couple."
The Facebook groups say: "Figure it out yourself."

everaftr, through the Fiesta lens, says: "This is your celebration. However you do it, with whatever budget you have, for whatever kind of love you share -- come to the fiesta. Kasama kita."

That is the brand. That is the strategy. Now let's execute.
