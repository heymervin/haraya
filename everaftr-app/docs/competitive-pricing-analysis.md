## 1. Market Context: Philippines Wedding Industry <a name="1-market-context"></a>

### Market Size Indicators

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Registered marriages (2023) | 414,213 | PSA |
| Registered marriages (2024) | 371,825 (-10.2% YoY) | PSA |
| Average wedding cost (standard, 100+ guests) | PHP 122,000 -- PHP 584,000 | Various |
| Average wedding cost (presentable, 2025) | PHP 300,000 -- PHP 1,000,000+ | Various |
| Intimate wedding cost | PHP 50,000 -- PHP 250,000 | Nuptials.ph |
| Peak month | February (12.4%), June (12.1%) | PSA |
| Top region | CALABARZON (14.6% share) | PSA |

### Estimated Addressable Market

- **~400,000 weddings/year** (declining trend, but still massive)
- **Conservative average spend: PHP 250,000** per wedding
- **Total wedding spend: ~PHP 100 billion/year** (~USD 1.8 billion)
- Even capturing 1% of vendor-side economics (commissions/advertising) = PHP 1 billion opportunity
- **Key trend**: Marriage numbers are declining, but average spend per wedding is rising as couples invest more in fewer, more elaborate celebrations

### Vendor Landscape

- Kasal.com claims ~20,000 wedding suppliers nationwide
- 49 vendor categories from small shops to national chains
- Highly fragmented -- mostly small/family businesses
- Digital adoption increasing but many vendors still rely on Facebook, Instagram, referrals

---

## 2. International Wedding Platforms <a name="2-international-wedding-platforms"></a>

### 2.1 The Knot / WeddingWire (The Knot Worldwide)

**Parent Company**: The Knot Worldwide (TKWW) -- private, operates in 16 countries
**Brands owned**: The Knot, WeddingWire, Hitched (UK), Bodas.net (Spain), Matrimonio.com, The Bump, The Bash

**Revenue Model: Vendor advertising subscriptions (primary)**

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Primary revenue** | Vendor advertising packages (subscription) |
| **Estimated revenue** | USD 100--500M annually |
| **Free tier (couples)** | Wedding websites, planning tools, registry, guest list -- all free |
| **Free tier (vendors)** | Basic listing exists but is effectively invisible; buried under paid advertisers; used mainly for review collection |
| **Paid vendor tiers** | Starts at USD 125--150/month; featured listings USD 700+/month; top categories (venues, photographers) pay USD 1,200--3,000/month |
| **Annual cost range** | USD 1,500 -- USD 36,000/year depending on market and category |
| **Contract** | 12-month commitment required |
| **Pricing factors** | Location (urban = 40--60% premium), vendor category, competition level |
| **Lead model** | Vendors pay for visibility, not per-lead; ranking in search is largely driven by spend level |

**What works:**
- Massive scale creates a self-reinforcing flywheel (couples go where vendors are, vendors go where couples are)
- Annual contracts ensure predictable revenue
- Bundled selling (Knot + WeddingWire together) maximizes ARPU
- Free tools for couples create enormous demand-side traffic

**What does NOT work:**
- Vendor complaints about lead quality are widespread
- "Pay-to-rank" model frustrates smaller vendors who cannot compete
- 12-month lock-in creates resentment when ROI is unclear
- Increasingly seen as a "tax" rather than a growth channel by vendors
- Recent response: TKWW announced new free and low-cost tiers, signaling the pure subscription model is under pressure

**Relevance to everaftr**: The TKWW model is the dominant paradigm but requires massive scale to work. Not viable for a new entrant. The vendor backlash is a strategic opportunity -- position against the "pay-to-play" model.

---

### 2.2 Zola

**Revenue Model: Diversified (registry commerce + vendor commissions + premium services)**

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Estimated revenue** | ~USD 120M annually |
| **Transaction volume** | USD 500M+ in wedding-related transactions (2024) |
| **Free tier (couples)** | Wedding website, registry, planning tools, guest list -- all free |
| **Registry commission** | 2.5% credit card processing fee on cash gifts (couple or guest absorbs); up to 40% margin on physical products sold through Zola; ~20% on experience gifts |
| **Vendor commissions** | Percentage of bookings generated through platform (undisclosed %) |
| **Premium services** | Paid upgrades: custom domain names, exclusive design templates |
| **Cash fund fee** | 2.5% processing (zero-fee option available via Venmo for qualifying registries with 100+ in gifts) |

**What works:**
- Brilliant demand-side monetization: couples pay nothing upfront, Zola monetizes through the transaction layer
- Registry is a natural monetization point -- guests are already spending money
- Product-led growth: free tools drive viral adoption (couples share wedding websites)
- Diversified revenue reduces dependence on any single stream

**What does NOT work:**
- Registry model requires e-commerce infrastructure and logistics
- Commission rates (20--40%) only possible because Zola acts as retailer, not just a marketplace
- US-centric -- registry culture is less established in the Philippines
- Premium website features generate modest revenue relative to registry

**Relevance to everaftr**: The "free for couples, monetize through transactions" philosophy is highly relevant. However, the registry model does not directly translate to the Philippines where cash gifts (monetary "envelopes") dominate and gift registries are uncommon. The vendor commission model is more transferable.

### 2.3 Hitched.co.uk (UK)

**Owner**: The Knot Worldwide (acquired February 2020)

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Revenue model** | Vendor advertising (same as The Knot) |
| **Free tier (couples)** | Wedding website builder, planning tools, supplier directory |
| **Vendor pricing** | GBP 175+/month for standard; GBP 1,604--5,039+ for 7--12 month packages |
| **National listing** | Under GBP 1,000/year for national listing |
| **Regional spotlights** | GBP 525+ VAT for 12 months per additional county |
| **Pricing model** | Negotiated with account managers (not transparent) |
| **Rotation vs. premium** | Vendors pick areas, shown in rotation; premium positioning costs more |

**What works:**
- Geographic targeting (by county) lets vendors control spend by region
- Rotation system gives free-tier vendors some (limited) visibility

**What does NOT work:**
- Non-transparent pricing creates sales friction
- Same vendor backlash issues as The Knot
- UK market has many competing directories (Guides for Brides, etc.)

**Relevance to everaftr**: Geographic targeting model is relevant for Philippines (Metro Manila vs. CALABARZON vs. Cebu vs. Davao). But the opaque, negotiated pricing model is NOT recommended for a new platform -- transparency builds trust.

---

### 2.4 Bridestory (Indonesia / SEA)

**History**: Founded 2014, acquired by Tokopedia 2019 (now part of GoTo Group)
**Most directly relevant competitor -- same region, similar market dynamics**

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Revenue model** | Vendor subscription + transaction fees (Bridestory Pay) |
| **Free tier (vendors)** | Trial account with limited credits (1 credit = 1 business lead); free listing visible while trial is active |
| **Lead-credit system** | Vendors receive free credits initially; when a couple sends inquiry, 1 credit consumed; once exhausted, must subscribe |
| **Subscription range (Indonesia)** | IDR 5M -- 60M per year (USD 376 -- USD 4,500) |
| **Subscription tiers** | Silver (unlimited credits, 10% discount on add-ons); Gold (unlimited credits, 15% discount, premium listing) |
| **Transaction fee** | 0 -- 1.8% on Bridestory Pay transactions (charged to vendor at payout) |
| **Premium listing** | Appears prominently in vendor lists |
| **Add-ons** | Social media packages, event participation, spotlight features |
| **Bridestory Pay** | Built-in payment system with 0% installment for clients up to 24 months |

**What works:**
- **Credit system is brilliant for cold start**: vendors join for free, experience value (leads), then convert to paid when credits run out -- a "try before you buy" model
- Transaction fee via Bridestory Pay captures value at the point of conversion
- Installment payments (up to 24 months) lower friction for couples booking expensive vendors
- Regional relevance (Southeast Asia, similar price sensitivity)
- Wedding fairs (Bridestory Market) create offline-to-online conversion events

**What does NOT work:**
- Revenue is "not their number one priority" (per founders) -- subsidized by Tokopedia/GoTo
- Credit system can feel opaque -- vendors unsure how many leads to expect
- Subscription pricing range is very wide (12x difference between lowest and highest tier)
- Limited Philippines presence

**Relevance to everaftr**: THIS IS THE MOST RELEVANT MODEL. The credit-based onboarding + subscription conversion funnel is ideal for a new platform. The installment payment system is highly relevant for the Philippines where couples are price-sensitive. The wedding fair strategy is directly applicable (Kasalang Filipino already validates this model). Consider a more transparent, simplified version of this approach.

## 3. Philippine-Specific Wedding Platforms <a name="3-philippine-specific-wedding-platforms"></a>

### 3.1 Kasal.com

**Established**: 2001 (oldest PH wedding platform)
**Scale**: ~20,000 suppliers, 49 categories, ~1M Facebook followers

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Revenue model** | Vendor listings + bridal fair revenue + content/media |
| **Free tier (vendors)** | Basic directory listing (minimal visibility) |
| **Paid tier** | "Priority Listed Vendor" -- placed at top of search results |
| **Priority benefits** | 2 exclusive feature articles, press release distribution, social media promotion |
| **Pricing** | NOT publicly available -- must contact sales (Tel: 02-8982-1176) |
| **Bridal fairs** | "Kasalang Filipino" -- nationwide wedding tourism fair roadshow; booth fees for vendors |
| **Content revenue** | Sponsored articles, social media posts for vendors |
| **Technology** | Website appears dated; limited planning tools for couples |

**What works:**
- First-mover advantage and brand recognition in Philippines
- 20,000+ vendor database is a significant asset
- Bridal fair business creates offline revenue and vendor relationships
- Long track record (25 years)

**What does NOT work:**
- **Dated technology** -- website UX is not modern, mobile experience is poor
- **No planning tools** beyond directory -- no budget calculator, no checklist, no wedding website builder
- **Opaque pricing** -- creates friction for vendor acquisition
- **No transaction layer** -- no payments, no booking, no way to capture conversion data
- **Content is not differentiated** -- competes with Bride and Breakfast on editorial but with less brand appeal
- **No app** -- purely web-based in a mobile-first market
- **Limited social proof** -- no review/rating system for vendors

**Relevance to everaftr**: Kasal.com's weaknesses are everaftr's opportunities. Their dated technology, lack of planning tools, absence of a transaction layer, and opaque pricing create a wide-open competitive gap. However, their 20,000-vendor database and bridal fair infrastructure mean they have deep industry relationships. everaftr should NOT try to out-directory Kasal.com on day one -- instead, differentiate on technology, UX, and the transaction/planning layer.

---

### 3.2 Bride and Breakfast PH

**Model**: Content/editorial-first wedding inspiration platform

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Revenue model** | Sponsored content + display advertising + vendor features |
| **Free tier (couples)** | All editorial content is free (real wedding features, inspiration, tips) |
| **Vendor monetization** | Sponsored articles, featured wedding stories, social media posts (via GetCraft and direct) |
| **Advertising formats** | Sponsored video, Facebook posts, Instagram content, banner ads |
| **Pricing** | NOT publicly available -- negotiated per campaign |
| **Content focus** | Celebrity weddings, luxury/aspirational weddings, vendor spotlights |
| **Social presence** | Strong Instagram and social media following |

**What works:**
- Strong brand identity in the "aspirational wedding" segment
- Content-first approach builds organic SEO traffic and social engagement
- Trusted editorial voice -- vendor features feel like endorsements, not ads
- Low overhead -- content business scales well

**What does NOT work:**
- **Not a marketplace** -- no direct vendor-couple matching, no booking, no transaction
- **Revenue is limited** -- sponsored content has natural capacity limits
- **Skews upmarket** -- focuses on luxury/celebrity weddings, less relevant for average Filipino couple
- **No vendor self-service** -- can't scale vendor acquisition because every engagement requires sales effort
- **No planning tools** -- purely inspirational, not functional

**Relevance to everaftr**: Bride and Breakfast proves that content drives discovery in the PH wedding market. everaftr should invest in content (real wedding features, vendor spotlights) as a demand-generation engine, but the content should funnel into the marketplace, not be the business itself. Consider partnerships or content syndication rather than competing head-to-head on editorial.

---

### 3.3 Nuptials.ph

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Revenue model** | Vendor directory + content (advertising-supported) |
| **Free tier (couples)** | Wedding supplier directory, budget guides, checklists, venue guides -- all free |
| **Vendor listings** | Appears to be primarily content-driven vendor lists rather than paid directory |
| **Pricing transparency** | Provides actual vendor price ranges (e.g., photographers PHP 35,000--75,000) -- highly useful |
| **Monetization** | Limited public information; likely display ads and sponsored content |
| **Differentiation** | More budget-conscious and practical than Bride and Breakfast |

**What works:**
- Fills a real gap: practical, budget-oriented wedding planning content
- Transparent vendor pricing information (rare in PH market)
- Good SEO on wedding cost queries

**What does NOT work:**
- Not a true marketplace -- no vendor profiles, reviews, or booking
- Limited scale and brand recognition vs. Kasal.com or Bride and Breakfast
- Monetization appears minimal

**Relevance to everaftr**: Nuptials.ph validates that Filipino couples desperately want pricing transparency. everaftr should make price transparency a core feature -- encourage vendors to display starting prices, and provide market-average pricing data to couples. This alone would be a major differentiator.

## 4. Analogous Philippine Marketplaces <a name="4-analogous-philippine-marketplaces"></a>

### 4.1 Carousell PH

**Revenue**: USD 119M globally (2024), 70%+ from SEA; net loss of USD 33.2M

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Revenue split** | Recommerce: USD 53M; Classifieds/Ads: USD 52.8M; Other: USD 13.5M |
| **Free tier** | Free listing for individuals |
| **Monetization tools** | Bumps (push listing to top), Spotlights (featured placement), CarouBiz subscription |
| **Bumps** | Pay to temporarily boost listing visibility; purchased with Carousell Coins |
| **Spotlights** | Featured placement ads; ~PHP 1,499 reported for a campaign |
| **CarouBiz** | Business subscription: virtual showroom, bulk bump discounts (up to 60% off), coins-back on spotlight clicks (up to 12%) |
| **Coins system** | Virtual currency for purchasing promotional tools |
| **VAT** | 12% VAT on purchases from June 2025 |
| **Listing fees** | Specific categories (Autos, Property, Jobs) have listing fees and quotas |

**What works:**
- **Coins/virtual currency** creates a spending flywheel and reduces payment friction
- **Tiered promotional tools** (bumps vs. spotlights) let sellers spend according to urgency/budget
- **CarouBiz subscription** locks in recurring revenue from power sellers
- **Freemium model** ensures massive supply-side inventory

**What does NOT work:**
- Still unprofitable after years of operation
- Recommerce revenue declining (-5.9% YoY)
- Complaints about ad quality and seller experience

**Relevance to everaftr**: The bump/spotlight model translates well to wedding vendors who want temporary visibility boosts (e.g., peak season, when they have availability). The virtual coins system is clever but may add unnecessary complexity for a new platform. The key lesson: offer both subscription AND transactional/a-la-carte promotion tools.

---

### 4.2 Kalibrr / JobStreet PH

**Two job platforms with different models, both relevant to vendor-side monetization**

| Aspect | Kalibrr | JobStreet PH |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| **Model** | Flat monthly fee based on active job posts | Per-posting fee with tiered plans |
| **Tiers** | SMB vs. Enterprise plans | Lite, Basic, Branded, Premium |
| **Pricing** | Not publicly disclosed; request-based | Variable by job title, location, candidate pool; from ~USD 149/post |
| **Extras** | Enterprise gets 5M-resume database access | Budget-based packages with volume discounts |
| **Alternative model** | Pay-per-hire option available | -- |
| **Key difference** | Subscription (predictable) | Transactional (flexible) |

**What works:**
- **Kalibrr's pay-per-hire** model is powerful: vendor (employer) only pays when they get value. This is the gold standard for marketplace trust-building.
- **JobStreet's tiered plans** (Lite to Premium) let employers self-select based on need and budget
- Both offer **self-service tools** for employers -- critical for scalability

**What does NOT work:**
- Non-transparent pricing on both platforms creates friction
- Enterprise-only features on Kalibrr exclude SMBs

**Relevance to everaftr**: The pay-per-hire model from Kalibrr maps directly to a potential "pay-per-booking" or "pay-per-confirmed-lead" model for wedding vendors. This is the most trust-building monetization approach for a new platform. Also, the tiered plan structure (Lite/Basic/Premium) is a clean framework for vendor subscriptions.

---

### 4.3 GrabFood / Foodpanda PH (Merchant Side)

| Aspect | GrabFood | Foodpanda |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| **Commission per order** | 10--30% (varies; 30% commonly cited for full service) | 25--30% + 2% gateway fee for mobile payments |
| **Variation factors** | Location (Metro Manila vs. provincial), restaurant size, negotiated rates | Same |
| **Merchant tools** | Self-service dashboard, promotions, analytics | Similar |
| **Who bears cost** | Merchant (deducted from order value) | Merchant |

**What works:**
- **Pure commission model** means zero upfront cost for merchants -- lowers barrier to entry
- Commission is only charged when actual revenue is generated -- aligned incentives
- Large-scale data and analytics tools justify the commission

**What does NOT work:**
- **25--30% commissions are brutal** on merchant margins, especially for small businesses
- Creates dependency and resentment -- merchants feel trapped
- Race to the bottom on pricing
- Delivery logistics cost is bundled into commission (not applicable to weddings)

**Relevance to everaftr**: A pure commission model on wedding bookings would align incentives perfectly (everaftr only earns when vendors earn). However, 25--30% commissions are NOT viable for wedding vendors whose margins are already thin and whose services are high-touch/custom. A lower commission (3--8%) on booked transactions could work, especially if combined with payment processing/escrow value.

## 5. Comparative Summary Matrix <a name="5-comparative-summary-matrix"></a>

| Platform | Primary Model | Free for Couples? | Free for Vendors? | Entry Price (Vendor) | Revenue Est. | Transaction Fee |
|----------|--------------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------------|-------------|----------------|
| The Knot/WeddingWire | Vendor subscription | Yes | Effectively no | USD 125--150/mo | USD 100--500M | None |
| Zola | Registry commerce + commissions | Yes | N/A (vendor commissions) | Commission-based | ~USD 120M | 2.5% processing |
| Hitched (UK) | Vendor subscription | Yes | Limited rotation | GBP 175+/mo | Part of TKWW | None |
| Bridestory (Indonesia) | Credits + subscription + txn fees | Yes | Yes (trial credits) | IDR 5M/yr (~USD 376) | Undisclosed | 0--1.8% |

| Kalibrr/JobStreet PH | Subscription + per-post + per-hire | N/A | N/A | ~USD 149/post | Undisclosed | None |
| GrabFood/Foodpanda PH | Commission per transaction | N/A | Yes (zero upfront) | 0 | Undisclosed | 10--30% |

## 6. Strategic Synthesis: Recommended Monetization Model for everaftr <a name="6-strategic-synthesis"></a>

### 6.1 Core Strategic Principles

Based on the competitive analysis, five principles should govern everaftr's monetization:

**Principle 1: Free for couples, always.**
Every successful wedding platform gives couples free access. This is non-negotiable. Couples ARE the product -- their attention and intent is what vendors pay for.

**Principle 2: Free-to-start for vendors.**
In a market where Kasal.com already has 20,000 vendors and brand recognition, everaftr cannot charge vendors upfront before proving value. The Bridestory credit model and Carousell's freemium approach both validate this. Vendors must experience value before paying.

**Principle 3: Monetize at the point of value creation.**
The GrabFood/Kalibrr commission and Zola transaction models show that the best monetization happens when value is clearly delivered -- a booking, a confirmed lead, a completed transaction. Avoid charging for "visibility" alone until scale is proven.

**Principle 4: Transparent, simple pricing.**
Kasal.com's opaque pricing, TKWW's negotiated rates, and Kalibrr's "contact us" model all create friction. Filipino SMB vendors (the "hard side" of this marketplace) need to understand exactly what they're paying for. Published pricing builds trust.

**Principle 5: Build the transaction layer.**
Bridestory Pay, Zola's registry, and GrabFood's order flow all demonstrate that owning the transaction is the ultimate monetization unlock. A platform that facilitates payments/deposits captures data, earns transaction fees, and becomes indispensable.

---

### 6.2 Recommended Monetization Architecture

#### PHASE 1: Market Entry (Months 0--12) -- "Build Trust, Prove Value"

**Revenue target: Break-even on operations, not profit maximization**

| Component | Details | Price |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| **Couple-side** | All planning tools free: wedding website builder, budget calculator, vendor search, checklist, guest list | FREE |
| **Vendor basic listing** | Profile, portfolio (up to 20 photos), 1 service category, contact via platform messaging | FREE |
| **Vendor verified listing** | Everything in Basic + verified badge, up to 50 photos, 3 categories, starting price display, review collection | FREE (during Phase 1) |
| **Boost (a la carte)** | Temporary visibility bump in search results (7-day duration) | PHP 299--499 per boost |
| **Featured Vendor (a la carte)** | Homepage/category page spotlight (30-day duration) | PHP 999--1,999 per month |
| **Content features** | Sponsored real-wedding stories or vendor spotlights (editorial team produces) | PHP 5,000--15,000 per feature |

**Phase 1 rationale:**
- FREE vendor listings attract supply side quickly
- A-la-carte boosts/features let early-adopter vendors "test" paid tools with minimal commitment
- No subscriptions, no contracts -- pure trust-building
- Content features generate revenue AND create SEO/social content
- Price points calibrated to PH SMB budgets (a photographer earning PHP 35,000--75,000 per wedding can justify PHP 499 for a boost)

**Phase 1 revenue model:**
- 1,000 vendors x 2 boosts/year average x PHP 400 avg = PHP 800,000
- 100 featured vendors x PHP 1,500 avg x 3 months avg = PHP 450,000
- 50 content features x PHP 10,000 avg = PHP 500,000
- **Phase 1 estimated annual revenue: PHP 1.75M (~USD 31,000)**
- This is intentionally modest -- the goal is vendor and couple acquisition, not revenue

---

#### PHASE 2: Growth (Months 12--24) -- "Introduce Subscriptions + Transaction Layer"

**Revenue target: PHP 10--20M annually**

| Component | Details | Price |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| **Free tier (vendors)** | Basic listing remains free; limited to 10 photos, 1 category, no analytics | FREE |
| **Starter plan** | Verified badge, 30 photos, 3 categories, basic analytics, 2 free boosts/month, review responses, starting price display | PHP 999/month |
| **Professional plan** | Everything in Starter + unlimited photos, all categories, advanced analytics, 5 free boosts/month, priority in search, featured badge, inquiry alerts | PHP 2,499/month |
| **Premium plan** | Everything in Professional + homepage placement, dedicated account support, branded vendor profile, social media features, event/fair priority | PHP 4,999/month |
| **Transaction fee** | On bookings/deposits processed through everaftr Pay | 3--5% (split: 2--3% vendor, 1--2% couple for payment processing) |
| **Booking protection** | Escrow service for couple deposits | Included in transaction fee |
| **Boosts (a la carte)** | Still available for non-subscribers | PHP 399--599 (price increases to incentivize subscriptions) |

**Phase 2 rationale:**
- Subscription tiers follow the Bridestory Silver/Gold model and JobStreet Lite/Basic/Premium structure
- PHP 999/month (Starter) is ~PHP 12,000/year -- affordable even for a small vendor booking 10+ weddings/year
- PHP 2,499/month (Professional) maps to roughly IDR 350,000/month -- aligned with Bridestory's lower tier
- Transaction fee of 3--5% is dramatically lower than GrabFood (25--30%) and justifiable as payment processing + escrow value
- Free tier remains to maintain supply-side breadth

**Phase 2 revenue model (conservative):**
- 500 Starter vendors x PHP 999/mo x 12 = PHP 5,994,000
- 200 Professional vendors x PHP 2,499/mo x 12 = PHP 5,997,600
- 50 Premium vendors x PHP 4,999/mo x 12 = PHP 2,999,400
- Transaction fees: 2,000 bookings x PHP 150,000 avg x 4% = PHP 12,000,000
- Boosts + features: PHP 2,000,000
- **Phase 2 estimated annual revenue: PHP 29M (~USD 516,000)**

---

#### PHASE 3: Scale (Months 24--36+) -- "Platform Economics"

| Component | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **everaftr Pay** | Full payment processing with installment options (3/6/12 months) via bank/fintech partnerships; analogous to Bridestory Pay |
| **everaftr Pro** | Premium SaaS tools for vendors: CRM, calendar/availability management, automated follow-ups, contract templates, invoicing |
| **Advertising** | Display ads and promoted placements for wedding-adjacent brands (jewelry, honeymoon travel, insurance, real estate) |
| **Data products** | Market insights and pricing benchmarks for vendors (anonymized); wedding trend reports for brands |
| **Events** | Own bridal fair/expo (a la Kasalang Filipino / Bridestory Market) |
| **Partnerships** | White-label vendor management for venues and hotels; affiliate commissions on honeymoon bookings, insurance, etc. |

### 6.3 Pricing Sensitivity Analysis (Philippines Context)

| Vendor Type | Typical Revenue/Wedding | Weddings/Year | Annual Revenue | Max Comfortable Platform Spend | % of Revenue |
|-------------|------------------------|---------------|----------------|-------------------------------|-------------|
| Photographer/Videographer | PHP 35,000--75,000 | 20--40 | PHP 700K--3M | PHP 12,000--36,000/yr | 1--5% |
| Wedding planner | PHP 20,000--200,000 | 10--25 | PHP 200K--5M | PHP 12,000--60,000/yr | 1--6% |
| Venue | PHP 50,000--500,000 | 50--200 | PHP 2.5M--100M | PHP 30,000--60,000/yr | 0.1--2.4% |
| Florist/Stylist | PHP 15,000--100,000 | 15--30 | PHP 225K--3M | PHP 6,000--36,000/yr | 1--5% |
| Catering | PHP 50,000--300,000 | 30--100 | PHP 1.5M--30M | PHP 12,000--60,000/yr | 0.2--4% |

**Key insight**: Filipino wedding vendors can comfortably spend 2--5% of annual revenue on a marketing/booking platform. The Starter plan at PHP 12,000/year falls within this range for nearly all vendor types.

**everaftr's positioning**: Start in the bottom-right quadrant (low cost, high functionality) and migrate upward as value is proven. This is the classic marketplace disruption path.

### 6.5 Cold Start Strategy

Based on the competitive analysis and marketplace theory:

**1. Start with the supply side in a single geography**
- Focus on Metro Manila first (largest market, highest digital adoption)
- Target 500 vendors across 10 core categories before launch
- Offer free verified listings + portfolio hosting as the "single-player mode" value

**2. The "hard side" is vendors -- win them with tools, not promises**
- Give vendors something valuable even with zero couples on the platform:
  - Free portfolio website (replaces their need for a separate website)
  - Free booking/inquiry management tool
  - Free contract templates and invoicing
- This is the Bridestory "credit" approach but even more generous: the tool IS the value, leads are a bonus

**3. Demand-side acquisition through content**
- Invest in editorial content (like Bride and Breakfast) to drive organic traffic
- Real wedding features, budget guides, venue reviews
- Every piece of content links to vendor profiles -- content becomes the discovery engine

**4. Bridal fair partnership or own event**
- Kasal.com's Kasalang Filipino and Bridestory Market prove offline events drive vendor acquisition AND couple engagement
- Partner with existing bridal fairs initially; own events later

**5. Transition to monetization only after proving lead generation**
- Only introduce paid tiers after vendors have received real inquiries/bookings
- The Bridestory credit model is the template: give value first, then charge for more

### 6.6 What to Avoid

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails | Who Did It |
|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| Charging vendors before proving leads | Vendors have been burned by pay-and-pray platforms | The Knot (vendor backlash) |
| 12-month contracts at launch | Destroys trust with SMB vendors | The Knot/WeddingWire |
| Commission rates above 10% | Wedding vendor margins are thin; creates resentment | GrabFood (25--30%) |
| Opaque/negotiated pricing | Filipino SMBs distrust hidden costs | Kasal.com, Hitched |
| Building only a directory | Zero defensibility; Facebook and Instagram already do this for free | Kasal.com, Nuptials.ph |
| Monetizing the couple side | Couples have infinite free alternatives; charging them kills demand | (No wedding platform does this successfully) |
| Trying to be everything on day one | Dissipates resources across both sides of marketplace | Classic marketplace failure |

---

### 6.7 Revenue Projection Summary

| Phase | Timeline | Vendors (Paid) | Couples (Active) | Annual Revenue | Key Monetization |
|-------|----------|----------------|-------------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Phase 1 | Months 0--12 | ~100 (a la carte) | 5,000--10,000 | PHP 1.75M | Boosts, features, content |
| Phase 2 | Months 12--24 | ~750 (subscribers) | 25,000--50,000 | PHP 29M | Subscriptions + transactions |
| Phase 3 | Months 24--36 | ~2,000 (subscribers) | 100,000+ | PHP 80--120M | Subscriptions + transactions + ads + SaaS |

---

### 6.8 Final Recommendation

**The optimal model for everaftr is a hybrid of Bridestory's credit-to-subscription funnel + Carousell's a-la-carte promotional tools + a lightweight transaction fee (inspired by Zola/Bridestory Pay), all executed with the pricing transparency that Philippine competitors lack.**

In short:
1. **Free tools** win vendors (Bridestory-style onboarding)
2. **Free content** wins couples (Bride and Breakfast-style discovery)
3. **A la carte boosts** generate early revenue (Carousell-style)
4. **Subscriptions** capture recurring value from proven ROI (Bridestory/The Knot-style)
5. **Transaction fees** on bookings/payments become the long-term revenue engine (Zola/GrabFood-style, but at 3--5%, not 25--30%)
6. **Pricing transparency** is the brand differentiator no PH competitor has claimed

This model respects the cold-start reality (you cannot charge before proving value), aligns incentives (everaftr earns when vendors earn), and scales naturally as the platform grows.
