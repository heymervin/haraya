### Interview Transcript

**Interviewer:** Congratulations sa engagement niyo! So tell me — right now, paano niyo sinimulan yung planning?

**Kat:** Honestly? Hindi pa namin talaga nasimulan. Like, I have a Pinterest board na matagal ko nang gina-grow — like years — pero in terms of actual planning? Wala pa. Parang ang dami kong gusto gawin pero 'di ko alam kung ano yung unahin.

**Jed:** Same. Yung nanay ko, the day after I told her, nag-text na agad ng "anak, ilan ba ninong at ninang niyo?" Sabi ko, "Ma, wala pa nga kaming date." *laughs* Pero ganon talaga eh. Lahat may opinion agad.

**Kat:** And like, my tita shared me sa isang Facebook group — "Wedding Suppliers Philippines 2026" — and grabe, ang daming posts. Overwhelming. May nagpo-post ng lechon for 8,000, may iba 15,000, hindi mo alam kung legit, kung good quality, kung may hidden charges. Tapos yung comments section, dami ring nag-aaway. *laughs*

---

**Interviewer:** So when you first start planning, what do you wish you could see all in one place?

**Kat:** For me, like a... roadmap? Yung tipong "you're here, and these are the steps para makarating ka sa wedding day." Kasi right now ang feeling ko parang nakatayo ako sa gitna ng intersection and lahat ng direction, may humaharang na tao — tita, supplier, friend na kakakasal lang — at iba-iba sinasabi nila.

**Jed:** Practical answer: I want to see timeline and budget side by side. Kasi yun yung dalawang pinaka-stressful for me. Like, kelan ba talaga kailangan i-book yung venue? Kasi yung iba sinasabi 12 months before, pero we're probably doing 8 months lang. And then how much? Kasi we still don't know how much we're working with because... *looks at Kat*

**Kat:** Because we haven't had The Talk with both sets of parents yet.

**Jed:** Yeah. That's a whole thing. So ang ideal for me, I can see: here's your checklist, here's how much each thing might cost, and here's when you should do it. All in one view.

**Kat:** But also — and I know this sounds superficial pero it matters to me — I want it to feel... nice? Like 'pag binuksan ko siya, 'di ako na-overwhelm. Yung ibang wedding planning sites kasi ang daming text, ang daming fields na fill-up-an, parang nag-aapply ka ng loan. *laughs* I want it to feel like I'm planning something exciting, hindi something stressful.

> **KEY QUOTE — Kat:** *"Parang nakatayo ako sa gitna ng intersection and lahat ng direction, may humaharang na tao — tita, supplier, friend na kakakasal lang — at iba-iba sinasabi nila."*

---

**Interviewer:** What's the most overwhelming part of wedding planning right now?

**Jed:** Budget. Walang question. Kasi it's not just our money eh. May pera galing sa parents ko, may pera galing sa parents ni Kat, tapos may sarili kaming savings. And each side has... expectations.

**Kat:** Conditions. *laughs* 'Yun ang tamang word.

**Jed:** *smiles* Okay, conditions. Like yung parents ko, very church-focused. Gusto nila sa Bulacan yung church. And then yung side ni Kat, they want a specific caterer kasi kamag-anak nila. So yung budget, it's not just numbers — it's politics.

**Kat:** For me, the most overwhelming part is parang... the sheer number of decisions? Like I Googled "wedding planning checklist" and yung lumabas, 200+ items. Two hundred! Sabi ko, "Jed, 'di tayo makakasal nito." I literally closed the tab.

**Interviewer:** So how could a hub page help with that feeling?

**Kat:** Kung makita ko siya and it feels like... manageable chunks? Like instead of "here are 200 things," it's "here are 5 categories, start wherever you want." Parang Netflix ba — hindi ka naman binibigyan ng lahat ng movies at once. May sections. May "Start Here."

**Jed:** For me, if there's a way to input our budget — even rough — and it shows where it goes, that would be killer. Kasi right now I'm trying to figure out: how much should catering be? How much for the venue? I don't have a frame of reference. I've been to weddings but I've never paid for one.

> **KEY QUOTE — Jed:** *"Budget is not just numbers — it's politics."*

---

**Interviewer:** If you landed on a planning page, what would make you think "ito yung para sa 'min" versus "ang complicated naman nito"?

**Kat:** First thing — if I see something that looks like it understands Filipino weddings. Not like, American wedding planning na may "rehearsal dinner" and "bridal shower registry at Target." If I see "Ninong & Ninang List" or "Entourage Planning" or something about a church coordinator — I'd feel like, oh, ito, gets nila.

**Jed:** For me, simple lang. Kung 'pag binuksan ko, two or three big buttons lang: Checklist, Budget, Guest List. Tapos ako na bahala mag-explore. Ayoko nung maraming pop-ups or tutorials. Let me figure it out.

**Kat:** Nako, ikaw kasi 'di mo binabasa yung instructions kahit saan. *laughs*

**Jed:** *laughs* Totoo. But seriously, I think if the page feels light — 'di maraming text, 'di maraming colors — okay na. Yung iba kasi ang cluttered.

**Kat:** Agree. And like — if I see progress? Even a small thing like "Congrats, you started your checklist!" — that already makes me feel like okay, nag-move na tayo. Kasi right now, zero progress kami and it feels paralyzing.

**Interviewer:** Jed, how about you on the "this is for me" part — does representation matter to you?

**Jed:** Honestly, yeah. Like 'pag yung photos puro Western couples sa garden wedding, parang... that's not our vibe. Our vibe is probably a church in the province and then a reception sa bahay or sa covered court. *laughs* Okay, maybe not covered court, pero you get it. If I see couples that look like us, situations that feel like ours — yeah, that matters.

---

**Interviewer:** How do you currently track your wedding planning?

**Kat:** I have a Notes app na may bullet points. Very messy. And then I have a Pinterest board with like 400 pins na wala namang organization. And then I screenshot things from Instagram and Facebook and they just... live in my gallery. Never to be found again.

**Jed:** I made a Google Sheet na. Three tabs: Budget, Guest List, Timeline. Pero it's very bare. And honestly si Kat 'di naman niya tinitingnan yun.

**Kat:** Kasi ang pangit tignan! Sorry, babe, pero it's just numbers. Walang joy.

**Jed:** It's functional!

**Kat:** Joy is also functional!

**Interviewer:** So if haraya could replace some of those tools, what would need to be true?

**Kat:** It needs to be as fast as my Notes app. Like I can open it, add a thought, close it. Kung kailangan ko mag-login, mag-load ng matagal, mag-navigate through three pages — forget it. I'll just type it in Notes.

**Jed:** For me, it needs to be at least as flexible as my Google Sheet. Kasi right now I can add any column I want. If your budget tool is too rigid — like, what if we have a category that doesn't fit? "Barong Tagalog for the groom" — does that fall under "attire" or "accessories"? I want to be able to customize.

> **KEY QUOTE — Kat:** *"Joy is also functional!"*

---

**Interviewer:** What would make you come back to this page every day or every week?

**Kat:** If it reminds me gently. Like, "Hey Kat, you haven't looked at your guest list in a while, and your RSVP deadline is in 3 weeks." But gently ha. 'Di yung guilt trip. *laughs*

**Jed:** If it saves us arguments. *laughs* No, seriously. Kung both of us can see the same page and we both know where we are, less miscommunication. Right now, I update my spreadsheet pero si Kat 'di naman naka-sync. So minsan I'll say, "nag-book na ako ng photographer," and she'll say, "ha? Sino? Kelan? Why didn't you tell me?"

**Kat:** BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T! *laughs* But yeah, point taken. If both of us can see everything real-time — that's a big reason to keep coming back.

**Jed:** And if it talks to the other tools. Like if I check off "Book Venue" on the checklist, yung budget should automatically show that expense as done. If I add ninongs to the guest list, the checklist should say "invite ninongs — done." If everything is connected, it's worth coming back to.

---

**Interviewer:** The celebration website builder — should it be front and center on this hub page, or is it secondary?

**Kat:** For me? I'm super excited about that. I would love to build our wedding website. Pero... not yet. Like, right now I don't even have a date to put on it. So it should be there, visible, pero maybe with a note like, "You can start this anytime, but it's best once you have your date and venue."

**Jed:** Secondary for me. I'd focus on checklist and budget first. Website is nice-to-have. It's not urgent.

**Kat:** Hmm but you know what, if the wedding website also handles RSVP — that's actually important early on. Because right now, how do we count guests? We're texting people one by one. If the website can do RSVP tracking and that connects to our guest list...

**Jed:** Oh, that's smart actually. Yeah. If the RSVP from the website feeds into the guest list tool, then it's more important than I thought.

**Kat:** See? Listen to your fiancee. *laughs*

> **KEY QUOTE — Kat:** *"It should be there, visible, pero maybe with a note like, 'You can start this anytime, but it's best once you have your date and venue.'"*

---

**Interviewer:** How do you feel about progress tracking? Like "You're 40% done with planning!"

**Kat:** I love that. I'm a progress bar person. Like sa Netflix, sa Duolingo, I love seeing progress. It makes me feel like we're getting somewhere.

**Jed:** Depends. If it's accurate, great. But kung yung 40% is based on some arbitrary checklist that doesn't apply to us — like, we're not having a "bridal shower" or a "bachelor party," we're having a despedida de soltera, and it's one event, not separate — then the percentage feels fake. And fake progress is worse than no progress.

**Kat:** Fair point. What if it's based on our own checklist? Like, we define what needs to get done, and the progress bar is based on that?

**Jed:** That I'm okay with. Our own metrics, not someone else's template.

**Kat:** Also — what if it shows progress per section? Like "Budget: 60% allocated, Guest List: 30% confirmed, Checklist: 5 of 20 tasks done." So we can see where we're behind.

**Jed:** That's actually really good. Yeah, per section. Not one overall number.

---

**Interviewer:** Last question — on your phone, how much scrolling is too much?

**Kat:** If I have to scroll more than... *thinks* two full swipes to see everything on the hub page? Too much. I want to see the main things — my checklist status, budget summary, and like one or two other things — without scrolling at all. And then maybe one scroll down for the rest.

**Jed:** Agree. Also, I should be able to tap on any section and go deep. But the hub page itself should be like a dashboard — snapshot lang. Hindi yung naka-display lahat ng details.

**Kat:** Like an executive summary! *laughs* Diba, corporate ka eh.

**Jed:** *laughs* Fine, oo. Executive summary ng kasal natin.

> **KEY QUOTE — Jed:** *"The hub page should be like a dashboard — snapshot lang. Hindi yung naka-display lahat ng details."*

## COUPLE 2: MID-PLANNING STAGE

### Participant Profiles

**Marco Santos**, 31 — Civil engineer, currently managing a construction project in Cavite. Detail-oriented, slightly controlling about timelines. From a big Bicolano family. Catholic. The one who handles vendor negotiations because "sanay ako mag-haggle sa hardware store." *his words*

**Denise Lim-Santos** (fiancee), 29 — Pediatric nurse at a hospital in Makati. Practical, direct, manages the guest list because she "knows everyone and their drama." Chinese-Filipino on her mother's side, which adds another layer of traditions (tea ceremony, Chinese banquet considerations). Works shifting schedules, so planning time is unpredictable.

**Status:** Engaged 7 months. Wedding is in 5 months. Venue is booked (a garden venue in Tagaytay). Church is booked (Nasugbu, Batangas — compromise between families). Date is set. Currently juggling: caterer selection, entourage finalization, guest list negotiations, and vendor coordination. Using a mix of Google Sheets, Viber groups, and a physical notebook.

**Device:** Marco: Samsung Galaxy S23. Denise: Samsung Galaxy A34.

### Interview Transcript

**Interviewer:** So you're about five months out — how's planning going?

**Denise:** Chaotic. *laughs* Like, we have a system naman, but every week may bago. Last week, yung ninang ni Marco — Tita Nena — nag-text, she wants to add three people sa guest list. Three! Sabi ko, "Tita, 150 na nga eh." Sabi niya, "Anak, family naman 'yan."

**Marco:** And yung three people, hindi ko kilala. *laughs* Pero 'di mo naman pwedeng sabihin no kasi ninang mo. So ngayon, 153 na. And that affects the catering count, the seating, the budget — everything.

**Denise:** This is our life now. Every text message is a potential domino effect.

---

**Interviewer:** When you think about all your planning tools right now, what do you wish you could see in one place?

**Marco:** I want to see how one change affects everything else. Like when Tita Nena added three people — I should see: catering cost goes up by X, seating arrangement needs to shift, maybe we need another table, which means the venue layout changes. Right now, I have to update three different things manually. Google Sheet for the budget, Viber group for the caterer, and then tell Denise to update the guest list.

**Denise:** Which sometimes he forgets.

**Marco:** I don't forget. I... delay.

**Denise:** That's forgetting with extra steps.

**Marco:** *laughs* Anyway. A central page where I can see: here's where we are with budget, here's the guest count, here's what's still pending — that would save us so many "babe, did you...?" conversations.

**Denise:** For me, I want to see what's urgent. I don't need to see everything all the time. I want to see: what's due this week? What's overdue? What needs a decision from both of us? Because I'm a nurse — my schedule is 'di predictable. I can't sit down for an hour and plan. I have 10 minutes between patients sometimes, and I want to open the app and know exactly what to do in those 10 minutes.

> **KEY QUOTE — Denise:** *"I have 10 minutes between patients sometimes, and I want to open the app and know exactly what to do in those 10 minutes."*

---

**Interviewer:** What's the most overwhelming part right now?

**Denise:** The guest list. Without question. Because it's not just a list — it's a negotiation. My side, Marco's side, our own friends, work friends, church community, yung mga ninong at ninang... And every name has baggage. Like, "if we invite Tito Boy, we have to invite Tita Luz, but Tita Luz and Tita Myrna aren't speaking, so we need to seat them far apart."

**Marco:** It's like a chess game.

**Denise:** It's like a war game. *laughs*

**Marco:** For me, the vendors. We're talking to maybe... 8 vendors right now? Caterer, photographer, videographer, florist, hair and makeup, host, sounds and lights, and the Barong tailor. Each one has a different timeline, different payment terms, different requirements. The caterer wants a final count by March. The photographer wants a shot list by April. The Barong tailor needs measurements this month kasi ang tagal ng turnaround. I have all of this in my head and it's... a lot.

**Denise:** And in different Viber chats! He has like 15 Viber chats open with vendors.

**Marco:** At least. And I can never find the quote someone sent me three weeks ago because it's buried under 200 messages of "noted po" and "thank you po."

**Interviewer:** How could a hub page help?

**Marco:** If I could see all my vendors in one place — who's booked, who's pending, when their deadlines are — that alone would be worth it. I don't need to chat with them through the app, I just need to track them.

**Denise:** And for the guest list — if there's a smart way to manage it. Like, tagging people by side (bride/groom/mutual), by group (family, friends, work), by RSVP status. And then the seating arrangement connects to that. So when Tita Nena adds three people, I tag them, assign a table, and it updates the count everywhere.

> **KEY QUOTE — Marco:** *"Every text message is a potential domino effect."*

---

**Interviewer:** If you landed on a planning page, what makes it feel right for you versus too complicated?

**Marco:** Cards. I want to see cards. Each tool is a card — Checklist, Budget, Guest List, Vendors, Website. Each card shows me a quick status: "12 of 30 tasks done," "Budget: 350K of 500K spent," "128 of 153 guests confirmed." I tap the card, I go deeper. Simple.

**Denise:** For me, it's about language. If the page uses terms I actually use — "entourage," "ninong/ninang," "abay," "cord sponsors," "veil sponsors" — then I trust it. If I see "wedding party" and "bridesmaids" and "groomsmen" only, it feels imported. Like it wasn't built for me. Haraya means imagination in Filipino, right? So it should feel Filipino.

**Marco:** Also, 'di dapat overwhelming yung first thing I see. Some planning tools, 'pag binuksan mo, ang daming alerts — "You're behind on 5 tasks! Your budget is over! 3 vendors haven't responded!" Parang pinapagalitan ka agad. Wag naman ganon.

**Denise:** *laughs* Oo, 'wag judgmental. Be supportive. Like, "You have 3 things to focus on this week. You got this." Motivate, don't guilt.

---

**Interviewer:** How do you currently track everything?

**Denise:** Okay, don't judge us, but... we have: one Google Sheet with 6 tabs — budget, guest list, entourage, vendor contacts, payment schedule, and timeline. Marco manages it. I have a physical notebook — yung Muji — where I write things down during breaks at work. And then we have a shared Google Keep for random notes like "ask caterer about lechon station vs. plated" or "Denise's mom wants round tables not long tables."

**Marco:** And Viber groups. One group for us and both parents — that's the main coordination. One group for the entourage. And then individual chats with each vendor.

**Denise:** Oh, and Pinterest for Denise's vision board.

**Marco:** That's your thing. I don't touch Pinterest.

**Denise:** He doesn't appreciate aesthetics.

**Marco:** I appreciate not going over budget. That's my aesthetic.

**Denise:** *laughs*

**Interviewer:** So that's at least 5 different platforms. Would you consolidate?

**Denise:** In a heartbeat. IF — and this is a big if — the replacement does everything well enough. Kasi yung problem with some tools, jack of all trades, master of none. I'd rather have a great checklist and a great guest list than a mediocre everything.

**Marco:** Agree. Start with the core — checklist, budget, guest list — and make those excellent. The rest can come later.

> **KEY QUOTE — Marco:** *"I appreciate not going over budget. That's my aesthetic."*

---

**Interviewer:** What would make you come back to this page regularly?

**Denise:** If it sends me a summary. Like a weekly email or push notification: "This week: finalize caterer, follow up on RSVP non-responders, pay photographer deposit." That would get me to open it.

**Marco:** If the data is real-time. Like, if Denise updates the guest list and I immediately see the budget impact. If I check off a task and it reflects on the dashboard. If the information is always current, I'll check it because I trust it.

**Denise:** Also — and this is specific — if it helps with the RSVP chase. Because right now, I'm individually texting people to confirm attendance. If the app has a way to send reminders or if the wedding website has an RSVP function that feeds into the guest list... that would save me hours. HOURS.

**Marco:** Oh, and a timeline view. Like a Gantt chart but simple. Kasi as an engineer, I love Gantt charts. *laughs* But seriously, seeing "Month 5: finalize vendors, Month 4: send invitations, Month 3: final fittings" — that kind of visual helps me stay on track.

---

**Interviewer:** The celebration website — important on the hub page?

**Marco:** We actually haven't built one yet. We're planning to use one — we want a place for RSVPs and maybe a photo gallery for guests to upload photos during the wedding. But right now it's not a priority.

**Denise:** I think it should be on the hub page, but not as big as checklist or budget. Maybe medium priority? Like, it's there, I can see it, but it's not the first thing I reach for.

**Marco:** Unless — what if the wedding website is where the RSVP system lives? Because if guests RSVP through the website, and that data goes to our guest list automatically, then the website is actually... infrastructure. It's not just a nice-to-have. It's a functional tool.

**Denise:** Oh. Yeah. Okay, that changes things. If the website is the RSVP collection point, then it should be more prominent. Because that's what I need — a way to collect RSVPs without texting everyone one by one.

**Marco:** So maybe the way to present it is not "Build your wedding website" but "Set up your RSVP system" and the website is the vehicle.

**Denise:** Yes! Frame it by what it does for us, not what it is.

> **KEY QUOTE — Marco:** *"Frame it by what it does for us, not what it is."*

---

**Interviewer:** Progress tracking — motivating or stressful?

**Marco:** Motivating. 100%. I'm an engineer. I live on project milestones. Show me a progress bar and I will chase it to 100%.

**Denise:** Hmm, for me it depends. If progress is measured by what we've decided — great. If it's measured by what we've done compared to some "ideal timeline" that's not ours — stressful. Because we're not on anyone else's timeline. We started late because I had a work thing. We're doing fine. I don't need an app to tell me we're "behind."

**Marco:** Fair. So maybe no "you're behind" messaging. Just "here's where you are."

**Denise:** Exactly. Neutral, not judgmental. "You've completed 15 of 28 tasks." Period. Don't add "you should be at 20 by now." Nobody needs that energy.

**Marco:** What if there are milestones? Like mini celebrations? "You booked your venue — that's huge!" or "Guest list passed 100 — wow!" Small moments that make you feel good.

**Denise:** THAT I would love. That's the opposite of judgment. That's cheerleading.

> **KEY QUOTE — Denise:** *"Neutral, not judgmental. 'You've completed 15 of 28 tasks.' Period. Don't add 'you should be at 20 by now.' Nobody needs that energy."*

---

**Interviewer:** Phone scrolling — how much is too much?

**Marco:** Two scrolls maximum for the hub page. Honestly, one scroll ideally. I should see the most important things immediately, and one scroll should show me everything else.

**Denise:** Agree. And the things above the fold — what I see without scrolling — should be actionable. Not decorative. Show me what needs my attention NOW.

**Marco:** Like an "action required" section at the top. Pending decisions, upcoming deadlines, things we both need to discuss. Then below that, the tool cards — checklist, budget, guest list, etc.

**Denise:** Ooh, yes. Like an "Inbox" for wedding planning. The urgent stuff at the top, the tools below.

**Marco:** And if there's nothing urgent — like everything's on track — then maybe just a chill message. "Everything's on track. Here are your tools." No fake urgency.

## SYNTHESIS & KEY FINDINGS

### Pattern 1: The "Where Do I Start?" Problem (Early Couples)

Both Jed and Kat expressed paralysis at the sheer number of decisions in wedding planning. They want the hub page to serve as a **gentle roadmap** — not a comprehensive list, but a curated starting point.

**Design Implication:** The hub page for new users should surface a "Start Here" or "Recommended First Steps" section that is contextual to their planning stage. Consider an onboarding question: "When's your wedding?" or "What have you done so far?" to tailor the page.

**Key Quotes:**
- *"Parang nakatayo ako sa gitna ng intersection"* — Kat
- *"200+ items. Sabi ko, 'Jed, 'di tayo makakasal nito.'"* — Kat

---

### Pattern 2: Connected Data is the Killer Feature (Both Couples)

Every participant, without prompting, described frustration with disconnected tools. Budget changes don't reflect in the guest list. Vendor payments aren't tracked alongside the checklist. The single most requested feature across both interviews was **data that talks to each other**.

**Design Implication:** The hub page should visually communicate that the tools are connected. When showing status cards, cross-reference data (e.g., "Guest List: 153 guests | Budget Impact: ~P76,500 catering"). Consider subtle visual links between cards.

**Key Quotes:**
- *"If I check off 'Book Venue,' yung budget should automatically show that expense as done."* — Jed
- *"Every text message is a potential domino effect."* — Marco

---

### Pattern 3: Filipino-Specific Language and Context Builds Trust

Both couples explicitly mentioned that Filipino wedding terminology — ninong/ninang, entourage, abay, cord sponsors, veil sponsors, despedida de soltera — is a trust signal. Seeing Western-only terminology creates distance.

**Design Implication:** Use Filipino wedding terms throughout the hub page. Not just translations — use the actual terms Filipino couples use. This is a key differentiator for Haraya as the Philippines' platform.

**Key Quotes:**
- *"If I see 'Ninong & Ninang List' or 'Entourage Planning'... I'd feel like, oh, ito, gets nila."* — Kat
- *"If I see 'wedding party' and 'bridesmaids' only, it feels imported."* — Denise

---

### Pattern 4: The Celebration Website is Infrastructure, Not Decoration

Initially, both couples rated the wedding website as secondary. But when the RSVP connection was discussed, both couples upgraded its importance significantly. The website is valuable when framed as a **functional tool** (RSVP collection, guest photo album) rather than a vanity page.

**Design Implication:** On the hub page, present the Celebration Website through its functional benefits: "Collect RSVPs," "Share event details," "Guest photo album." De-emphasize the "build a website" framing. Consider whether the RSVP feature deserves its own card or prominent link.

**Key Quotes:**
- *"Frame it by what it does for us, not what it is."* — Marco
- *"If the RSVP from the website feeds into the guest list automatically, it's not a nice-to-have — it's infrastructure."* — Marco

---

### Pattern 5: Progress Tracking — Yes, But On Their Terms

All four participants want progress visibility, but with strict conditions: it must reflect THEIR plan (not a generic template), it must be neutral in tone (not judgmental or behind-schedule shaming), and milestone celebrations are universally welcomed.

**Design Implication:** Progress bars should be per-section (not one overall number), based on user-defined tasks, and accompanied by celebratory micro-moments rather than deficit messaging. Never use language like "you're behind" or "you should be at X by now."

**Key Quotes:**
- *"Our own metrics, not someone else's template."* — Jed
- *"Neutral, not judgmental."* — Denise
- *"Mini celebrations... that's cheerleading."* — Marco

---

### Pattern 6: The Hub Page is a Dashboard, Not a Deep Dive

All four participants want the hub page to be a **snapshot view** — quick status, actionable next steps, and easy navigation to deeper tools. Maximum two scrolls on mobile. Most important content must be above the fold.

**Design Implication:** Hub page structure (top to bottom):
1. **Above the fold:** Urgent actions / "Focus this week" section + quick stats (days until wedding, tasks done, budget remaining, guests confirmed)
2. **One scroll down:** Tool cards with status summaries (Checklist, Budget, Guest List, Celebration Website, Matchmaker Quiz, Favorites)
3. **Nothing below that.** If there's more content, it belongs inside the individual tools, not on the hub.

**Key Quotes:**
- *"The hub page should be like a dashboard — snapshot lang."* — Jed
- *"The things above the fold should be actionable. Not decorative."* — Denise

---

### Pattern 7: Shared Access Reduces Couple Friction

Both couples described planning friction caused by information asymmetry — one partner updates something, the other doesn't know. Real-time shared access is not a feature; it is a relationship preservation tool.

**Design Implication:** The hub page should make it visually clear that both partners see the same data. Consider subtle indicators like "Last updated by Marco, 2 hours ago" or activity feeds. The "both of us" framing matters.

**Key Quotes:**
- *"If both of us can see everything real-time — that's a big reason to keep coming back."* — Kat
- *"Pending decisions, upcoming deadlines, things we both need to discuss."* — Marco

---

## SPECIFIC FEATURE REQUESTS (Unprompted)

| Request | Who | Priority Signal |
|---|---|---|
| "Start Here" guided flow for new users | Kat | High — directly addresses paralysis |

| Guest list tagging (side, group, RSVP status) | Denise | High — directly reduces "negotiation" overhead |
| RSVP collection via Celebration Website feeding into Guest List | Kat, Denise, Marco | High — once understood, all rated this critical |
| Timeline / visual roadmap (simplified Gantt) | Marco, Kat | Medium — planning stage visualization |
| "Nothing urgent" calm state for the hub | Marco | Low but meaningful — avoids false urgency |
| Customizable checklist categories (not rigid templates) | Jed | Medium — flexibility matters to power users |

## OPEN QUESTIONS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH

1. **Onboarding segmentation:** How much onboarding is too much? Should we ask couples their planning stage upfront, or infer it from their behavior?
2. **Partner collaboration model:** Do both partners want equal hub page views, or does one partner want a "lite" view? (Kat and Jed had different depth preferences.)
3. **Notification tolerance:** How many push notifications per week before it feels spammy? Denise wanted weekly summaries; would daily nudges be too much?
4. **Vendor tracking scope:** Marco's request for vendor tracking is significant but wasn't in the original tool set. Is this a future tool, or should it live within the checklist?
5. **Family stakeholder access:** Both couples mentioned parents and titas having opinions and adding guests. Is there a role for limited family member access (e.g., a view-only guest list for parents)?
