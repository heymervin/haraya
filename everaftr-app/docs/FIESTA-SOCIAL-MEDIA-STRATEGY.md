## 1. Market Context & Platform Strategy

### The Philippine Social Media Landscape (2026)

The Philippines remains one of the most social media-saturated countries on earth. The numbers that matter for everaftr:

- **95.8 million** social media user identities (81.9% of total population)
- **3 hours 32 minutes** average daily time on social media (vs. 2h21m global average)
- **8.36 platforms** used per person on average -- Filipinos do not live on one platform
- **Mobile-first** is not a strategy, it is reality. Android dominates.

### Platform Roles for everaftr

#### FACEBOOK -- The Foundation (Priority 1)

**Role:** Primary community hub, lead generation engine, and trust-builder.

Facebook is not optional in the Philippines. It IS the internet for most Filipinos. With 94.9% of Filipino online users accessing Facebook monthly, this is where everaftr builds its core audience.

**Why it matters for everaftr:**
- Filipino brides-to-be live in Facebook Groups. Groups like "Practical Brides and Wedding Promos Philippines," "Bride and Breakfast Wedding Community," and dozens of regional wedding groups have hundreds of thousands of active members.
- Facebook is where Filipinos make purchasing decisions. Vendor discovery, price comparisons, reviews -- this all happens in Facebook threads.
- Messenger (90.6% usage) is the default communication channel. Couples will DM, not email.
- Facebook Events and Marketplace integrations are useful for vendor promotion.

**Facebook Strategy Breakdown:**

| Component | Approach |
|-----------|----------|
| **Page** | @everaftr.ph -- brand presence, content distribution, ads hub |
| **Group** | "everaftr Community -- Filipino Wedding Planning" -- the heart of engagement |
| **Messenger** | Auto-replies + Kasa AI integration (future), inquiry handling |
| **Reels** | Cross-post from Instagram/TikTok, native Facebook Reels for algorithm boost |
| **Stories** | Daily stories: polls, Q&As, vendor spotlights, countdowns |
| **Live** | Weekly or biweekly lives: vendor Q&As, planning workshops, couple AMAs |

**Posting Frequency:** 1-2 Page posts/day, 3-5 Group interactions/day, daily Stories, 3-4 Reels/week.

**Best Posting Times (PHT):**
- Weekdays: 6:00 PM - 8:00 PM (after-work scroll)
- Mornings: 7:00 AM - 9:00 AM (commute scroll)
- Weekends: 10:00 AM - 12:00 PM (leisurely browsing)

---

#### TIKTOK -- The Discovery Engine (Priority 2)

**Role:** Top-of-funnel awareness, viral reach, and brand personality showcase.

TikTok has 62.3 million Filipino users aged 18+, with users spending an average of 40 hours per month on the platform. It has surpassed Facebook in time-per-user. This is where everaftr gets discovered by couples who do not know they need a wedding planning platform yet.

**Why it matters for everaftr:**
- 82.2% of Filipino online users access TikTok monthly.
- Couples increasingly use TikTok to find vendors -- photographers, videographers, stylists.
- Wedding content is evergreen on TikTok. A "Budget Breakdown: 200-guest Tagaytay Wedding for 500K" video can get views for months.
- The algorithm favors new accounts that post consistently -- everaftr can gain traction fast.

**Content Types That Work in PH Wedding TikTok:**

| Format | Example | Why It Works |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| **Budget Breakdowns** | "Magkano talaga ang kasal? 300K budget, ito ang na-cover namin" | Filipinos are practical planners. Real numbers = saves + shares. |
| **Vendor Reveals** | POV: First look at your venue / "Wait for the transformation" | Reveal/transition content is irresistible. |
| **GRWM Bride Edition** | "Get ready with me: Filipino church wedding" | Personal, relatable, high watch time. |
| **Storytime** | "How we planned our wedding in 3 months (as OFWs)" | Narrative + emotion = comments + shares. |
| **Couple Challenges** | "Groom answers wedding quiz" / "How well do you know your partner?" | Couples tag each other. Viral loop. |
| **Tips in 60 Seconds** | "3 things you NEED to know about CENOMAR" | Educational + urgent = saves. |
| **Sound-Driven Content** | Use trending PH sounds (OPM, Filipino memes, viral audio) | Algorithm boost from trending audio. |
| **Before/After** | Venue styling transformations, invitation design process | Satisfying visual progression. |

**Posting Frequency:** 1-2 videos/day (minimum 5/week during launch).

**Best Posting Times (PHT):**
- Weekdays: 7:00 AM - 8:00 AM, 11:00 AM - 1:00 PM, 5:00 PM - 7:00 PM
- Weekends: 10:00 AM - 2:00 PM

---

#### INSTAGRAM -- The Lookbook (Priority 3)

**Role:** Visual brand identity, aspirational content, vendor portfolio showcase, and social proof.

Instagram usage in the Philippines sits at 71.2% of online users. While not as dominant as Facebook, Instagram serves a critical role: it is where your brand looks professional. Filipino couples, especially those in the 25-35 ABC demographic, use Instagram for visual inspiration and vendor vetting.

**Why it matters for everaftr:**
- Instagram is the "portfolio" platform. Vendors check your IG before partnering. Couples check it before trusting your platform.
- The Instagram grid IS your brand. A well-curated Fiesta-branded grid communicates credibility instantly.
- Reels drive discovery (2.46% engagement rate vs. 0.70% for static posts).
- Instagram's algorithm now prioritizes "Sends Per Reach" -- content people share via DM is the strongest signal.

**Instagram Strategy Breakdown:**

| Component | Approach |
|-----------|----------|
| **Feed Posts** | Curated Fiesta-branded graphics, vendor spotlights, real wedding features |
| **Reels** | Cross-posted from TikTok (adjusted for IG format), behind-the-scenes, tips |
| **Stories** | Daily: polls, Q&As, link stickers to everaftr.ph, countdowns, reposts |
| **Highlights** | Organized by: Vendors, Tips, Real Weddings, About Us, Kasa AI, FAQs |
| **Carousels** | "Swipe-through" educational content: checklists, budget guides, timelines |
| **Guides** | Curated vendor collections by category, regional guides |

**Posting Frequency:** 4-5 Feed posts/week, 4-5 Reels/week, daily Stories.

**Best Posting Times (PHT):**
- Weekdays: 8:00 AM, 12:00 PM - 2:00 PM, 6:00 PM
- Wednesday is the strongest day for IG engagement in PH

**Grid Aesthetic Strategy (see Section 3 for full details):**
The grid follows a repeating 3-column rhythm:
- Column 1: Fiesta-colored tip/educational graphic
- Column 2: Photo-forward content (real weddings, vendor work)
- Column 3: Quote/testimonial on white canvas with banderita accent

---

#### PINTEREST -- The Long Game (Priority 4)

**Role:** SEO-driven evergreen discovery for high-intent planners.

Pinterest has 40.5% usage among Filipino online users, which is higher than many expect. While it is not a primary engagement platform, it serves a unique purpose: Pinterest users are planners. They are actively searching for "Filipino wedding invitation designs," "Tagaytay wedding venues," and "Philippine wedding budget breakdown."

**Why it matters for everaftr:**
- Pinterest content has the longest shelf life of any platform (pins can drive traffic for years).
- Wedding is one of Pinterest's top categories globally.
- everaftr blog content and vendor directory can be repurposed as pins that drive traffic to everaftr.ph.
- Low competition from Filipino wedding brands on Pinterest = opportunity to own the space.

**Strategy:**
- Create a business account: @everaftr.ph
- Set up boards: "Filipino Wedding Inspiration," "Budget-Friendly Kasal Ideas," "Philippine Venue Guide," "Wedding Planning Checklists PH," "Fiesta Wedding Aesthetic"
- Pin every blog post, every vendor spotlight, every checklist as a branded pin
- Use keyword-rich descriptions in Tagalog and English
- Target: 10-15 pins/week (can be batched and scheduled)
- Track clicks-to-site as the primary KPI

**Best Practice:** Every Instagram carousel and infographic should be reformatted as a vertical Pinterest pin (2:3 ratio, 1000x1500px). This doubles the value of every piece of content.

---

#### TWITTER/X -- Not a Priority (Deprioritized)

**Role:** Brand presence only. Do not invest resources here.

At 41.2% usage, X has moderate reach in the Philippines but serves a fundamentally different purpose (news, politics, fandom). Filipino wedding conversation does not happen here. The time spent creating X content is better spent on Facebook, TikTok, and Instagram.

**Minimal Presence:**
- Claim @everaftr_ph
- Auto-cross-post key announcements
- Monitor for brand mentions
- Revisit quarterly

---

### Platform Priority Summary

| Platform | Priority | Role | Time Investment |
|----------|----------|------|----------------|
| Facebook (Page + Group) | 1 | Community, Trust, Leads | 35% |
| TikTok | 2 | Discovery, Virality | 25% |
| Instagram | 3 | Brand Image, Portfolio | 25% |
| Pinterest | 4 | Evergreen SEO Traffic | 10% |
| X/Twitter | 5 | Monitoring Only | 5% |

---

## 2. Content Pillars

Six content pillars form the backbone of all everaftr social content. Every post should map to one of these pillars. The pillars are designed to serve different stages of the wedding planning journey and different audience motivations.

---

### Pillar 1: "Vendor Spotlight" (Kilala Mo Ba?)

**Purpose:** Showcase the 80+ vendors in the everaftr directory, build trust, drive vendor partnerships, and give couples a reason to use the platform.

**Frequency:** 3x per week across platforms.

**Formats:**

| Format | Platform | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| **Vendor Reel** | IG/TT/FB | 30-60 second video featuring vendor work, BTS, or interview snippet. Open with their best shot. End with "Find them on everaftr.ph" |
| **Vendor Card** | IG/FB | Branded graphic with vendor photo, name, category, location, price range, and 1-line quote. Fiesta color border matching their category. |
| **"Anong Presyo?"** | TT/FB | Price transparency series. "Magkano ang flowers for 20 tables? Let's ask @vendorname." Filipinos love knowing real prices. |
| **Vendor Takeover** | IG Stories | Vendor takes over everaftr Stories for a day. Shows their process, answers questions. |
| **Carousel Feature** | IG | 5-slide carousel: Slide 1 = hero image, Slides 2-4 = portfolio, Slide 5 = booking info + CTA |

**Example Post (Instagram Carousel):**

```
Slide 1: [Photo of stunning floral arrangement]
         "Your dream flowers? Meet @bloomsbymaría"

Slide 2: [3 portfolio images in grid]
         "From intimate garden weddings to grand ballroom setups"

Slide 3: [Photo of Maria working]
         "Maria has styled 200+ weddings across Metro Manila and Tagaytay"

Slide 4: [Testimonial quote on Fiesta Coral background]
         "Hindi kami makapaniwala sa ganda. Exactly what we envisioned." -- Couple from Antipolo

Slide 5: [everaftr branded CTA]
         "Find Blooms by Maria on everaftr.ph
          Book your free consultation today.
          Link in bio."
```

**Caption:**
```
Flowers na mag-pa-wow sa guests mo? Say hello to @bloomsbymaría.

200+ weddings styled. Fresh blooms only. Available for Metro Manila, Cavite, Laguna, and Tagaytay.

Mag-browse ng more florists sa everaftr.ph -- link in bio.

Sino ang florist ng dreams mo? Tag them below!

#everaftr #PlanTogetherCelebrateForevr #FilipinoWeddingFlowers #WeddingFloristPH #KasalanGoals
```

**Why This Works in PH:**
- Filipino couples ask "sino supplier mo?" in every Facebook comment section. everaftr becomes THE answer.
- Vendors share their own features, giving everaftr organic reach to the vendor's audience.
- Price transparency ("Anong Presyo?") is a magnet because Filipino wedding groups are 50% "HM po?" posts.

---

### Pillar 2: "Filipino Wedding Tips" (Gabay sa Kasal)

**Purpose:** Establish everaftr as the go-to expert on Philippine wedding planning. Cover the uniquely Filipino aspects: legal requirements, cultural traditions, and practical budget advice.

**Frequency:** 3-4x per week across platforms.

**Content Themes:**

| Theme | Example Topics |
|-------|---------------|
| **Legal & Documents** | CENOMAR guide (what it is, how to get it, processing time, online vs. walk-in), marriage license requirements by city, Pre-Cana seminar guide, NSO vs. PSA differences |
| **Budget Hacks** | "Kasal for under 300K -- possible ba?", DIY vs. full-service comparison, which vendor categories to splurge on vs. save, payment installment strategies |
| **Cultural Traditions** | Cord and veil ceremony explained, coin ceremony significance, choosing ninong/ninang (the politics of it), Filipino reception traditions (money dance, bouquet/garter) |
| **Timeline Planning** | 12-month countdown checklist, 6-month rush wedding guide, "When to book what" calendar |
| **Venue Guides** | "Top 10 Tagaytay venues under 200K," Church vs. garden ceremony pros/cons, hotel vs. standalone venue comparison |
| **OFW-Specific** | Planning from abroad guide, virtual supplier meetings, proxy document processing, timezone-friendly planning tips |

**Formats:**

| Format | Platform | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| **Infographic Carousel** | IG/FB | 5-10 slide swipeable guide. e.g., "CENOMAR Application: Step by Step" |
| **60-Second Tips** | TT/IG Reels | Talking head or text-on-screen. "3 things your wedding coordinator won't tell you" |
| **Long-form Post** | FB Page/Group | 500+ word post with practical advice. FB rewards text-heavy content in groups. |
| **Checklist Download** | All | "Save this!" content with downloadable checklist via everaftr.ph link |
| **Live Q&A** | FB/IG Live | Monthly "Ask Us Anything" about wedding planning |

**Example Post (TikTok/Reels):**

```
[Hook -- Text on screen]: "Engaged ka na pero wala ka pang CENOMAR? STOP."

[Talking head or voiceover with graphics]:
"CENOMAR means Certificate of No Marriage. Required 'to sa lahat ng civil at church weddings sa Pilipinas.

Step 1: Go to PSA Serbilis online -- psa.gov.ph
Step 2: Fill out the request form. Need mo: full name, birthdate, birthplace.
Step 3: Pay P210 for regular processing (10 business days) or P420 for express.
Step 4: It gets delivered to your address.

Pro tip: If OFW ka or nasa abroad, pwede ka mag-request through Philippine embassy or consulate. Process is longer -- start 3 months before your wedding date.

More guides like this? Follow @everaftr.ph and download our free checklist -- link in bio."

[End card]: everaftr logo + "plan together, celebrate forevr"
```

**Why This Works in PH:**
- CENOMAR, marriage license, and Pre-Cana questions flood every single Filipino wedding group daily. This content will be searched, saved, and shared endlessly.
- Budget content performs extraordinarily well because Filipino weddings are family-funded affairs with real financial pressure.
- OFW content taps an underserved audience of 2.16 million Filipinos abroad, many of whom are planning weddings back home with zero local support.

### Pillar 3: "Real Celebrations" (Totoong Kasalan)

**Purpose:** User-generated and editorial stories of real Filipino weddings. This is the emotional core of the brand -- proof that everaftr celebrates love as it actually is, not just the magazine version.

**Frequency:** 2-3x per week across platforms.

**Content Types:**

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Full Wedding Feature** | 8-10 image carousel (IG) or 90-second highlight reel (TT/Reels) of a real wedding. Include couple's story, vendor credits, budget transparency (optional). |
| **Couple Story** | 60-second couple interview: "How did you meet? How did you plan? What advice would you give?" Film on phone -- authenticity over production value. |
| **Budget Reveal** | Couples share their actual wedding budget breakdown. "We had 150 guests in Batangas for 400K. Here's how." This is GOLD in PH. |
| **Behind-the-Scenes** | Day-of footage from the couple's perspective. Raw, emotional, real. |
| **Cultural Celebrations** | Highlight diverse Filipino wedding traditions: Muslim Filipino weddings, Cordillera weddings, Ilocano weddings, Visayan traditions, Chinese-Filipino weddings. The Philippines is not monolithic. |
| **Second Marriages / Late Blooms** | Older couples, second chances, long engagements finally realized. Expands the narrative beyond 25-year-old brides. |

**Example Post (Instagram Carousel + Facebook):**

```
Slide 1: [Hero photo of couple, smiling, candid]
         "Jai & Marco | Batangas Garden Wedding"

Slide 2: [Ceremony photo]
         "They met on a dating app in 2022. 'Hindi namin inexpect na ganito kabilis,' says Jai."

Slide 3: [Detail shots: invitation, flowers, rings]
         "Their Fiesta-inspired palette: coral, gold, and lots of greenery"

Slide 4: [Reception photo, guests laughing]
         "150 guests. Family-style catering. Live acoustic band."

Slide 5: [Couple dancing]
         "Total budget: P380,000. 'Possible talaga. Prioritize what matters to you.'"

Slide 6: [Vendor credits on Fiesta Gold background]
         "Venue: @farmatlora | Flowers: @petalstudioph | Photo: @jcapturesph
          Catering: @hidalgosfeast | Coordination: @weddingsbyrey
          All found on everaftr.ph"

Slide 7: [CTA on white with banderita stripe]
         "Your love story could be next.
          Share your celebration: hello@everaftr.ph
          #TotoongKasalan"
```

**Caption:**
```
"Wala kaming planner. Wala kaming million-peso budget. Pero alam namin ang gusto namin -- isang celebration na totoo."

Jai and Marco planned their Batangas garden wedding in 5 months on a 380K budget. They found 4 of their 6 vendors through everaftr.

Their advice to newly engaged couples? "Huwag kayong matakot mag-DIY. And use tools that actually help -- hindi yung nagpapastress lang."

#everaftr #TotoongKasalan #RealFilipinoWedding #BatangasWedding #WeddingBudgetPH #PlanTogetherCelebrateForevr
```

**Why This Works in PH:**
- Filipino couples are skeptical of platforms that only show aspirational, unattainable weddings. Real stories with real budgets build trust.
- Budget transparency is social currency in PH wedding communities. "Magkano lahat?" is always the top comment.
- Vendor credits drive vendor partnerships. Vendors will want to be featured, which means they will push couples to use everaftr.

---

### Pillar 4: "Fiesta Feels" (The Brand Pillar)

**Purpose:** Pure brand storytelling. This pillar builds the emotional identity of everaftr -- the fiesta spirit, the celebration of Filipino love, the joy. Not every post needs a CTA. Some just need to make people feel something.

**Frequency:** 2-3x per week across platforms.

**Content Types:**

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Quote Graphics** | Filipino love quotes, OPM lyrics, couple submissions. On-brand Fiesta visuals. |
| **Memes & Relatable Content** | Filipino wedding humor. "Pag sinabi mong intimate wedding pero 200 guests." Filipino humor is self-deprecating, family-oriented, and very specific. |
| **Trending Audio/Sounds** | TikTok/Reels set to trending Filipino audio -- OPM, viral sounds, meme audio. Pair with wedding content. |
| **Filipino Love Language** | Explore "pagmamahal" in all forms: the tita who cooks for 3 days before the wedding, the kuya who drives the bridal car, the lola who sews the bride's dress. |
| **Fiesta Moments** | Colorful, joyful content that embodies the brand -- confetti, banderita, dancing, celebration. |
| **Team Behind everaftr** | Humanize the brand. Show the team, the building process, the "why." Filipino audiences love knowing the tao behind the product. |

**Example Post (TikTok/Reels):**

```
[Trending Filipino audio -- something celebratory or emotional]

Text on screen: "Filipino wedding culture is when..."

[Quick cuts]:
- Your guest list starts at 50 and ends at 300
- Ninong and ninang selection becomes a family meeting
- "Simple lang" means different things to you and your parents
- The food budget is bigger than the venue budget
- Your tita insists on lechon even though you wanted a garden party
- And despite everything... it's the best day of your life

[End screen]: "Your kasal, your way. everaftr.ph"

#FilipinoWedding #KasalanProblems #everaftr
```

**Why This Works in PH:**
- Relatable content is the most shared content type in the Philippines. Filipinos tag friends, partners, and family in comments.
- Humor breaks the ice. It makes everaftr feel like a friend, not a corporation.
- Emotional content (the love language posts) taps into the deep family-centeredness of Filipino culture.

---

### Pillar 5: "Kasa Says" (AI Assistant / Product Pillar)

**Purpose:** Introduce and normalize the Kasa AI assistant. Make it a character, not just a feature. Show how it helps with real planning decisions.

**Frequency:** 1-2x per week across platforms.

**Content Types:**

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **"Ask Kasa"** | Screen recordings of real Kasa interactions. "We asked Kasa to help plan a 500K wedding. Here's what it said." |
| **Kasa Tips** | Short-form tips presented as if from Kasa. Branded template with Kasa avatar. |
| **Product Demo** | Quick walkthrough of everaftr features using Kasa as the guide. |
| **Kasa vs. Tita** | Humorous series: Kasa's practical advice vs. your tita's unsolicited opinions. |
| **"Kasa, Paano..."** | Series where followers submit questions and Kasa answers on video/graphic. |

**Example Post (Instagram/Facebook):**

```
[Branded graphic: Kasa avatar on Fiesta Blue background]

"Kasa says:

'If your total budget is P400,000 and you have 150 guests, here's how I'd suggest splitting it:

Venue & Catering: P160,000 (40%)
Photo & Video: P60,000 (15%)
Attire & Beauty: P40,000 (10%)
Flowers & Styling: P36,000 (9%)
Entertainment: P20,000 (5%)
Invitations & Favors: P16,000 (4%)
Coordination: P28,000 (7%)
Contingency: P40,000 (10%)

Want me to find vendors that fit this budget? Open everaftr.ph and let's plan together.'"
```

**Caption:**

**Why This Works in PH:**
- Budget allocation is the #1 question in every Filipino wedding group. Kasa providing instant, personalized answers is genuinely useful.
- Making Kasa a character (not just a chatbot) gives people something to engage with and remember.
- The "Kasa vs. Tita" series leverages the universal Filipino experience of family involvement in wedding planning.

### Pillar 6: "Pista ng Pag-ibig" (Community / Campaign Pillar)

**Purpose:** Seasonal campaigns, community challenges, user-generated content drives, and cultural moments. This is the dynamic pillar that changes with the calendar.

**Frequency:** Varies by campaign cycle. See Section 4 for the launch campaign.

**Ongoing Content Types:**

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Monthly Themes** | Each month ties to a Filipino cultural moment or wedding season milestone. |
| **Community Challenges** | "Show us your proposal story," "Post your ring selfie," "Tag your wedding squad." |
| **Giveaways** | Partner with vendors for monthly giveaways. Engagement requirement: follow + tag + save. |
| **Cultural Calendar** | Content around: Valentine's (Feb), Wedding Season (Jun, Dec), Flores de Mayo (May), Christmas/holiday engagements (Nov-Dec). |
| **Matchmaker Quiz Promos** | Drive traffic to the vendor matchmaker quiz on everaftr.ph through social teasers. |

---

### Content Pillar Distribution (Weekly)

| Pillar | Mon | Tue | Wed | Thu | Fri | Sat | Sun |
|--------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| Vendor Spotlight | | X | | X | | X | |
| Filipino Wedding Tips | X | | X | | X | | |
| Real Celebrations | | | X | | | X | |
| Fiesta Feels | X | | | X | | | X |
| Kasa Says | | X | | | | | X |
| Community/Campaign | | | | | X | | |

This is a guideline, not a rigid schedule. Flexibility is built in for trending moments, breaking vendor partnerships, and spontaneous community engagement.

## 3. The Fiesta Visual Language on Social

### Design System Overview

The everaftr Fiesta visual identity must be instantly recognizable across all platforms. The goal: someone scrolling their feed should be able to identify an everaftr post in 0.5 seconds, even without seeing the logo.

### The Five Fiesta Colors

| Color | Name | Hex Code | Social Media Usage |
|-------|------|----------|-------------------|
| Coral | Fiesta Coral | #FF6F61 | Primary accent. Used for CTAs, headlines, and high-energy posts (tips, announcements). |
| Blue | Fiesta Blue | #4A90D9 | Trust and calm. Used for informational content, Kasa-related posts, legal/document guides. |
| Gold | Fiesta Gold | #FFD700 | Celebration and premium feel. Used for real wedding features, vendor spotlights, achievements. |
| Green | Fiesta Green | #2ECC71 | Growth and freshness. Used for budget content, checklists, DIY tips. |
| Purple | Fiesta Purple | #9B59B6 | Creativity and culture. Used for cultural traditions, emotional stories, Fiesta Feels content. |

### Color Usage Rules for Social Posts

**Rule 1: White Canvas First**
Every post starts on a white (#FFFFFF) or near-white (#FAFAFA) background. The Fiesta colors are accents, not backgrounds. This keeps the feed clean, modern, and breathable -- a contrast to the visual noise of most Filipino social media.

Exception: Full-bleed color backgrounds are allowed for strong CTAs, announcements, and quote graphics, but should not exceed 20% of total feed posts.

**Rule 2: One Hero Color Per Post**
Each post should feature ONE dominant Fiesta color as its accent. This creates a rhythm in the grid. Do not use all five colors on a single graphic unless it is a banderita element.

**Rule 3: The Banderita Accent**
The banderita (triangular pennant) stripe is everaftr's signature visual element. Use it as:
- A top or bottom border on graphics (thin stripe, 30-50px)
- A diagonal accent across a corner
- A divider between text sections in carousels
- A frame element in Stories templates

The banderita uses all five Fiesta colors in repeating sequence: Coral, Blue, Gold, Green, Purple. The triangles should be small, clean, and geometric -- not hand-drawn or childish.

**Rule 4: Color-to-Pillar Mapping**

| Content Pillar | Primary Color | Secondary Color |
|----------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Vendor Spotlight | Gold | Coral |
| Filipino Wedding Tips | Green | Blue |
| Real Celebrations | Coral | Gold |
| Fiesta Feels | Purple | Any |
| Kasa Says | Blue | Green |
| Community/Campaign | All (banderita) | -- |

This mapping ensures visual variety in the feed while maintaining brand coherence.

### Instagram Grid Strategy

**The 3x3 Grid Block System:**

Every 9 posts (which form a 3x3 visible block on the profile) should follow this visual rhythm:

```
Row 1: [Photo]     [Graphic]    [Photo]
Row 2: [Graphic]   [Photo]      [Graphic]
Row 3: [Photo]     [Graphic]    [Photo]
```

- **Photo posts:** Real wedding photos, vendor work, behind-the-scenes, team photos. Always edited with a consistent filter/preset (warm, slightly desaturated, natural light look).
- **Graphic posts:** Branded templates with Fiesta colors, text-forward content (tips, quotes, Kasa says). Always on white canvas with color accents.

This creates a checkerboard effect that looks curated when someone visits the profile.

**Alternative: The Row Strategy**

For campaigns, switch to a row-based grid:

```
Row 1: [Teaser 1]  [Teaser 2]   [Teaser 3]    -- All same visual theme
Row 2: [Photo]     [Graphic]    [Photo]         -- Normal rhythm
Row 3: [Feature 1] [Feature 2]  [Feature 3]    -- Vendor series
```

### Template Concepts (Canva-Ready)

**Template 1: "Tip Card"**
- White background
- Fiesta color block in top-left corner (circle or rectangle)
- Pillar label in the color block (e.g., "GABAY SA KASAL" in white text)
- Bold headline in black
- Body text in dark gray
- Banderita stripe at the bottom
- everaftr logo bottom-right
- Size: 1080x1350px (4:5 ratio for Instagram)

### Reel/TikTok Thumbnail Style

Thumbnails are critical -- they determine whether someone taps on your video from your profile grid.

**Thumbnail Rules:**
1. **Custom thumbnails always.** Never use a random frame from the video.
2. **Bold text overlay** in white or Fiesta color with drop shadow for readability.
3. **Face in the frame** whenever possible (faces increase tap-through by 30%+).
4. **Fiesta color border** -- a thin (20px) border in the pillar's primary color.
5. **Consistent font** -- use the same bold sans-serif across all thumbnails.
6. **Text should be 5 words or fewer.** Example: "CENOMAR in 3 Steps" or "300K Wedding Budget."

**Thumbnail Template (Canva):**
- Size: 1080x1920px (TikTok) or 1080x1350px (IG Reels cover)
- Background: Frame from video (or custom photo)
- Overlay: Semi-transparent Fiesta color gradient at bottom (30% opacity)
- Text: 2 lines max, white bold sans-serif, centered
- Logo: Small everaftr watermark in bottom corner
- Border: Thin Fiesta color line

### Typography on Social

- **Headlines:** Bold, modern sans-serif (e.g., Montserrat Bold, Poppins Bold)
- **Body text:** Clean, readable sans-serif (e.g., Inter, Open Sans)
- **Accent text:** Script or serif for quotes only, sparingly (e.g., Playfair Display)
- **Filipino text:** Same fonts. Never use a "handwritten" font for Tagalog -- it reduces readability.

### Photography Style Guide

When sourcing or shooting photos for social:

- **Lighting:** Natural, warm, golden hour preferred
- **Tone:** Joyful, candid, movement -- not stiff posed shots
- **Diversity:** Show Filipino couples of all shades, body types, and backgrounds
- **Settings:** Mix of aspirational (resort venues) and accessible (backyard celebrations, church weddings)
- **Color:** Lean into warmth. Avoid blue/cold tones. The Fiesta palette should feel natural in the imagery.
- **Editing:** Consistent preset -- warm highlights, lifted shadows, natural skin tones. Never over-filtered.

## 5. Growth Hacks (PH-Specific)

### 5.1 Facebook Group Infiltration (Without Being Spammy)

Filipino wedding Facebook groups are goldmines, but they are also heavily moderated and their members are allergic to promotional spam. Here is the approach:

**Step 1: Become a Genuine Member First**

Before ever mentioning everaftr, spend 2-3 weeks as a helpful member in the top wedding groups:

- **Groups to join:** "Practical Brides and Wedding Promos Philippines" (500K+ members), "Bride and Breakfast Community," "Kasal.com Community," "Budget Brides Philippines," "Wedding Suppliers Philippines," plus regional groups (Cebu Brides, Davao Weddings, Laguna/Batangas Wedding Suppliers)
- **Activity:** Answer questions genuinely. "For CENOMAR, I recommend going through PSA Serbilis online -- processing takes about 10 business days." Do NOT mention everaftr.
- **Goal:** Build name recognition for the person posting (founder or community manager). People will start recognizing you as "yung laging sumasagot ng maayos."

**Step 2: Organic Mentions (Week 3+)**

Once you have credibility:
- When someone asks "May alam ba kayong app for wedding planning?" -- naturally mention everaftr. "We actually just launched something for this -- everaftr.ph. It's free to try."
- When someone asks for vendor recommendations, share a helpful answer AND "I compiled a list of [category] vendors in [area] on everaftr.ph if you want to browse more."
- Share everaftr blog content (not homepage links) when relevant. "I wrote a guide about this exact topic: [blog link]." Content links are received better than product links.

**Step 3: Provide Value That Only You Can**

Create content specifically for group posting:
- Free downloadable checklists (PDF, hosted on everaftr.ph -- captures email)
- Budget calculator screenshots from Kasa
- Vendor comparison charts
- "I asked 50 couples how much they spent on [category]. Here's what I found."

**Step 4: Group Admin Relationships**

- DM group admins directly. Introduce everaftr. Ask if you can do a "vendor highlight" series in the group or host a Live event.
- Offer to be a guest expert for group Q&A sessions.
- Some groups allow pinned posts from verified partners -- negotiate this.

**What NOT to do:**
- Never post "Sign up for everaftr!" cold
- Never post the same content in 10 groups simultaneously (admins talk to each other)
- Never use engagement bait ("Comment 'YES' if you want a free checklist!")
- Never argue with existing vendor recommendations -- be additive, not competitive

---

### 5.2 Filipino Influencer/Creator Strategy

**Tier Strategy:**

| Tier | Followers | Cost (PH Market) | Quantity Needed | Usage |
|------|-----------|-------------------|-----------------|-------|
| **Nano** | 1K-10K | Free product/feature or P1,000-3,000 | 30-50 | Volume. Real couples who happen to have followings. Most authentic. |
| **Micro** | 10K-100K | P3,000-15,000 | 10-20 | Sweet spot. High engagement, niche audiences. Wedding planners, photographers, lifestyle creators. |
| **Mid-Tier** | 100K-500K | P15,000-50,000 | 3-5 | Awareness spikes. Filipino lifestyle, couple, or family creators. |
| **Macro** | 500K+ | P50,000-200,000+ | 1-2 (when budget allows) | Major launch moment. Celebrity couple or top creator partnership. |

**Types of Creators to Target:**

1. **Wedding Vendor-Creators** -- Photographers, videographers, planners, stylists who create content about their work. They already have the audience.
   - Approach: "We want to feature you on everaftr. In exchange, could you share the feature with your audience?"
   - Win-win: They get exposure, you get their audience.

2. **Couple Creators** -- Filipino couples who document their relationship/wedding journey on TikTok or Instagram.
   - Approach: "We'd love to feature your love story on everaftr. Would you be open to trying our platform and sharing your honest experience?"
   - Ideal: Couples who are actively planning (not already married).

3. **Lifestyle/Female Creators** -- Filipino women 25-35 who create content about adulting, finances, relationships.
   - Approach: Sponsored content. "5 apps that saved me when planning my wedding" or similar listicle format.

4. **Finance/Budgeting Creators** -- Filipino personal finance TikTokers/IGers.
   - Approach: "Wedding budget breakdown" collaboration. They talk about the money side, you provide the tool.

5. **OFW Creators** -- Filipino creators based abroad who document OFW life.
   - Approach: "Planning your wedding back home from abroad" content angle.

**Specific Accounts to Research and Approach:**

Note: The following are categories and types of accounts to search for on each platform. Specific account availability and relevance should be verified at the time of outreach.

- Wedding photographers with strong social presence (search "wedding photographer Philippines" on IG/TT)
- Popular wedding coordinators who post BTS content
- Bride and Breakfast collaborators (check their tagged content for active creators)
- Filipino couple vloggers on YouTube/TikTok who are newly engaged
- Toast Wedding Fair exhibitors (they already invest in marketing)
- OPM artists who recently got married (they may be open to sharing their vendor experience)

### 5.3 Cross-Promotion with Vendors

This is the most capital-efficient growth strategy for everaftr.

**The Vendor Growth Loop:**

```
everaftr features vendor on social --> Vendor shares the feature --> Vendor's couples discover everaftr --> Couples use everaftr --> Couples review vendor on everaftr --> More couples find vendor through everaftr --> Repeat
```

**Tactical Plays:**

1. **"As Seen on everaftr" Badge** -- Create a digital badge vendors can add to their own social profiles. "Verified Vendor on everaftr.ph." This is free advertising from every vendor.

2. **Co-Created Content** -- Work with vendors to create content that both accounts share. "Behind the scenes with @vendorname -- now on everaftr.ph." Both accounts post simultaneously.

3. **Vendor Referral Program** -- "Refer a vendor to everaftr. When they join, you both get featured in our weekly Vendor Spotlight."

4. **Exclusive Deals for everaftr Couples** -- Negotiate small discounts or perks that vendors offer exclusively to couples who found them through everaftr. This gives couples a reason to use the platform and gives vendors a reason to promote it.

5. **Vendor Content Kit** -- Give vendors a branded content kit (Canva templates, suggested captions, hashtags) that makes it dead-simple to post about everaftr. Remove all friction.

---

### 5.4 Wedding Fair Social Strategy

Wedding fairs are MASSIVE in the Philippines. Toast Wedding Fair (co-presented by Bride and Breakfast) is the biggest, with the next one scheduled for March 7-8, 2026 at World Trade Center Pasay -- directly within the launch campaign window.

**Pre-Fair:**
- Post "We'll be at [Fair Name]! Visit us at Booth X."
- Create a social-specific reason to visit: "Show this post at our booth for a free [gift]."
- Story countdown to the event.

**During Fair:**
- Live Story coverage: Booths, vendors, crowd energy, fiesta vibes.
- TikTok content: "Let's explore Toast Wedding Fair together" walkthrough.
- Capture UGC: Photo wall with banderita backdrop, branded frame for couples to take selfies with.
- QR code everywhere: Standees, flyers, even stickers on giveaway items. All pointing to everaftr.ph.
- Collect sign-ups on tablets at the booth (offline-first for reliability).

**Post-Fair:**
- Share highlights and recap content.
- Follow up with every couple who signed up (email + Messenger).
- Feature fair vendors who are also on everaftr.

**If everaftr cannot afford a booth yet:**
- Attend as a guest and create guerrilla content (fair walkthrough videos, vendor interviews in the aisle).
- Partner with a vendor who HAS a booth -- co-share their space.
- Distribute branded materials (small banderita-designed cards with QR code to everaftr.ph) outside the venue or in common areas.

---

### 5.5 OFW Couple Targeting

With 2.16 million OFWs and an even larger global Filipino diaspora (~10 million), this is a significant underserved segment.

**Why OFW Couples Are Valuable:**
- They are planning Philippine weddings but have no local access to venue visits, vendor meetings, or fairs.
- They have higher disposable income (dual OFW couples especially).
- They are more digital-native by necessity -- they already manage life through apps and video calls.
- They are deeply underserved by existing Philippine wedding platforms that assume Manila-based, in-person planning.

**Social Strategy for OFW Couples:**

1. **Dedicated Content Series:** "OFW Wedding Planning Guide" -- monthly content addressing their specific challenges.
2. **Time Zone-Friendly Engagement:** Post content at times that also catch Middle East (GMT+3/4), US West Coast (GMT-8), and SGP/HK (GMT+8) audiences.
3. **Facebook Groups:** Join OFW-specific groups ("OFW Philippines," "Pinoy in Dubai," "Filipinos in Canada," etc.) and share everaftr's remote planning features.
4. **Messenger/Chat Support:** OFW couples cannot call Philippine vendors during office hours. Kasa AI and everaftr's async tools are a major selling point.
5. **Real OFW Stories:** Feature couples who planned their wedding from abroad using everaftr. This is powerful social proof.
6. **Targeted Ads:** When running paid social (Section 7), create specific ad sets targeting Filipinos living abroad with "engaged" or "wedding" interests.

## 6. Community Building

### 6.1 The everaftr Facebook Group

**Group Name:** "everaftr Community -- Plan Your Filipino Wedding"

**Why Facebook Group (not Discord or others):**
- Facebook Groups are where Filipino communities live. 94.9% of online Filipinos use Facebook.
- Groups have built-in discovery (Facebook recommends groups to members with matching interests).
- The target demographic (25-35 year old Filipino couples, especially those outside Metro Manila) are heavy Facebook Group users.
- Group posts appear in members' feeds organically -- free distribution.

**Group Structure:**

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Privacy** | Private group (requires approval to join). This creates exclusivity and makes members feel they are part of something. |
| **Membership Questions** | 3 questions: (1) "When is your wedding date?" (2) "How did you hear about everaftr?" (3) "What's your biggest wedding planning challenge right now?" -- These are both data collection and spam filtering. |
| **Cover Photo** | Branded Fiesta design with group name and tagline. |
| **Rules** | Pinned post: Be respectful, no direct selling without permission, no MLM, vendor promos only on designated days, keep it wedding-related. |
| **Weekly Threads** | Structured engagement (see below). |

**Weekly Thread Schedule:**

| Day | Thread | Purpose |
|-----|--------|---------|
| **Monday** | "Wedding Win Monday" | Members share a planning milestone. "Booked our venue!" "Sent out invitations!" Celebration culture. |
| **Tuesday** | "Tip Tuesday" | everaftr team shares one actionable tip. Members contribute their own. |
| **Wednesday** | "Vendor Wednesday" | Open thread for vendor recommendations, reviews, and questions. Vendors can post their own work (with context, not just ads). |
| **Thursday** | "Tanong Thursday" (Question Thursday) | No question is too basic. "How do I choose between 2 venues?" "Is 300K realistic for 200 guests?" |
| **Friday** | "Fiesta Friday" | Fun/light content. "Show us your ring!" "What OPM song is your first dance?" "Share your save-the-date." |
| **Saturday** | "Supplier Saturday Deals" | Vendors can post promotions and discounts. Keeps promo content contained to one day. |
| **Sunday** | "Love Story Sunday" | Couples share their love story or wedding journey update. UGC gold. |

**Moderation Strategy:**

- **Minimum 2 moderators** active daily. At least one should be from the everaftr team.
- **Auto-moderation:** Facebook's built-in tools to filter spam, link posts, and new member posts for review.
- **Zero tolerance** for: MLM/pyramid scheme promotion, harassment, unsolicited DMs to members, fake vendor accounts.
- **Vendor verification:** Vendors who want to participate should be verified (ideally, they should be listed on everaftr.ph). Unverified vendors can participate in conversations but not promote services.
- **Tone:** Warm but firm. Community guidelines are enforced with empathy. "We love your enthusiasm, but please save vendor promos for Saturday's thread."

**Growth Tactics for the Group:**

- Every everaftr social post should mention the group: "Join our community for more tips -- link in bio."
- "Invite a friend who's getting married" periodic prompts.
- Exclusive content only shared in the group (early vendor announcements, special discounts, behind-the-scenes).
- Monthly group milestones: "We just hit 1,000 members! Salamat, fam!"

---

### 6.2 Discord (Secondary -- Future Consideration)

Discord is not a priority at launch. Filipino adoption is growing but still niche compared to Facebook. Revisit when the community reaches 5,000+ Facebook Group members and there is demand for a more real-time, chat-based space.

If launched, Discord would serve:
- Real-time chat for actively planning couples (channels by wedding date: #2026-weddings, #2027-weddings)
- Vendor AMA (Ask Me Anything) sessions
- Kasa bot integration for instant planning assistance

---

### 6.3 Engagement Tactics That Work in PH

| Tactic | Why It Works in PH | How to Execute |
|--------|--------------------|--------------------|
| **Giveaways** | Filipinos LOVE giveaways. "Free" is the strongest word in Filipino marketing. | Monthly giveaway in partnership with vendors. Mechanics: Follow + Like + Tag + Share to Story. Prize: Vendor service (hair & makeup, photobooth, etc.). |
| **Contests** | Competition + creativity = engagement. | "Best Proposal Story" contest. Submit via comment or DM. Community votes. Winner gets featured + prize. |
| **Polls & "This or That"** | Low effort, high engagement. Filipinos love giving opinions. | "Beach wedding or garden wedding?" "Long gown or short dress for reception?" Stories polls, Facebook polls, TikTok comments. |
| **React-to-Win** | Simple mechanics = mass participation. | "React with the heart emoji and you could win a free planning consultation!" (Facebook-specific) |
| **Live Q&As** | Real-time interaction builds trust. Filipinos are heavy Facebook Live consumers. | Biweekly Facebook/IG Live: vendor interviews, planning workshops, team AMAs. |
| **Tag-a-Friend** | Organic growth mechanic. Filipinos tag enthusiastically. | "Tag your maid of honor!" "Tag someone who needs this tip!" in every caption. |
| **"Relate ka ba?"** | Relatability is the #1 engagement driver in PH. | Post relatable wedding planning scenarios. "Raise your hand if your guest list went from 100 to 300." Comments = reach. |
| **Shout-outs** | Public recognition motivates participation. | "Shout-out to @username for the best tip in yesterday's thread!" Feature active community members. |

---

### 6.4 Encouraging User-Generated Content (UGC)

UGC is the lifeblood of a community platform. For everaftr, UGC means: couple photos, wedding stories, vendor reviews, planning tips, and real celebration content.

**UGC Strategies:**

1. **Make It Easy** -- Provide templates. "Share your love story using this template: Where you met / How long you've been together / Wedding date / Dream wedding in 3 words."

2. **Make It Rewarding** -- Feature UGC on the main @everaftr.ph accounts. Being "featured" is a powerful motivator in PH social media culture. "Your photo could be on our page!"

3. **Create a Ritual** -- #TotoongKasalan is the ongoing UGC hashtag. Every Sunday = Love Story Sunday. Couples know the format and when to post.

4. **Lower the Bar** -- Not every UGC needs to be a professional photo. Phone selfies, screenshots of planning milestones ("Just booked our caterer!"), even memes count.

5. **Seed the Content** -- In the early days (first 60 days), the everaftr team should create "UGC-style" content themselves. Post from personal accounts, ask friends who are couples to participate. Normalize the content format before expecting organic submissions.

6. **Permission Always** -- Always ask before reposting someone's content. DM: "We love your photo! Can we share it on our page with credit?" Filipinos generally say yes enthusiastically, but asking builds trust.

---

## 7. Paid Social Strategy (When Ready)

### 7.1 When to Start Paid Social

**Not Day 1.** Paid social should begin after:
- The organic content library has 30+ posts (so there is a profile to land on)
- The platform (everaftr.ph) is live and stable
- There is a clear conversion action (sign-up, quiz completion, vendor inquiry)
- The team can handle increased traffic and inquiries

**Recommended:** Start paid social in Week 3 of the launch campaign (Day 18+), after organic momentum is established.

---

### 7.2 Facebook & Instagram Ads

Facebook/Instagram Ads are the primary paid channel. The targeting capabilities for the Philippine market are unmatched.

**Campaign Structure:**

| Campaign | Objective | Audience | Budget |
|----------|-----------|----------|--------|
| **Awareness** | Reach/Video Views | Broad: Filipino, 22-38, interested in "Weddings," "Engagement rings," "Wedding planning" | 30% of budget |
| **Consideration** | Traffic to everaftr.ph | Narrowed: Engaged (life event), interested in wedding vendors, active in wedding groups | 40% of budget |
| **Conversion** | Sign-ups / Quiz completions | Retargeting: Website visitors, video viewers (75%+), page engagers | 30% of budget |

**Targeting Layers:**

| Layer | Options |
|-------|---------|
| **Demographics** | Age 22-38, Philippines (all regions + key international: UAE, Saudi, Singapore, Hong Kong, USA, Canada, UK, Japan, South Korea) |
| **Life Events** | "Newly engaged" (within 3 months, 6 months, 1 year) -- this is the most powerful targeting signal on Facebook |
| **Interests** | Wedding planning, Wedding photography, Bridal gown, Wedding dress, Engagement ring, Wedding venues, Wedding invitations, Kasal.com, Bride and Breakfast, Wedding coordinator |
| **Behaviors** | Recent mobile device users (Android priority), Frequent travelers (for OFW targeting), Online purchasers |
| **Custom Audiences** | Website visitors (Pixel), Video viewers, Page/profile engagers, Instagram engagers |
| **Lookalike Audiences** | 1% lookalike of sign-ups, quiz completers, or high-intent page visitors |

**Ad Formats That Work:**

1. **Reels Ads** -- 15-30 second vertical video. Native-feeling, not overly polished. "This couple found their dream vendor in 3 minutes" with screen recording.
2. **Carousel Ads** -- Swipeable vendor showcases or wedding tip series. Each card links to a different vendor category.
3. **Stories Ads** -- Full-screen vertical. Quick CTA. "Swipe up to take the matchmaker quiz."
4. **Lead Generation Ads** -- Facebook Lead Form. Capture name, email, wedding date without leaving Facebook. Lower friction for Filipino users who dislike leaving the app.

**Ad Creative Best Practices for PH:**
- Use Taglish (Tagalog-English mix) in ad copy. Pure English feels cold. Pure Tagalog feels overly formal.
- Show real Filipino couples, not stock photos. Representation matters.
- Include price/value signals early. "Free to use" or "80+ vendors, 0 fee" in the first line.
- Mobile-optimized: Large text, vertical format, fast hook (first 3 seconds).
- Include social proof: "Join 1,000+ couples already planning on everaftr" (when you have the numbers).

**Cost Estimates (Philippine Market):**

| Metric | Estimated Range |
|--------|----------------|
| CPM (Cost per 1,000 impressions) | P50 - P150 |
| CPC (Cost per click) | P1 - P8 |
| CPL (Cost per lead/sign-up) | P15 - P50 |
| Cost per quiz completion | P20 - P60 |

These are estimates based on Philippine market benchmarks. Wedding-related targeting tends toward the higher end due to competition from venues, photographers, and bridal brands.

---

### 7.3 TikTok Ads

TikTok Ads are secondary but increasingly powerful in PH.

**When to Start:** After establishing organic TikTok presence (500+ followers, 10+ videos with measurable performance data).

**Best Ad Format:** Spark Ads -- boost existing organic posts that are already performing well. This preserves authenticity while expanding reach.

**Targeting:** Similar to Facebook but less granular. Focus on age (22-35), Philippines, interests (wedding, relationships, home & living).

**Budget:** Start with P5,000-10,000/week testing Spark Ads on top-performing organic content. Scale what works.

---

### 7.4 Budget Recommendations

**Phase 1: Pre-Revenue (Months 1-3)**

| Allocation | Monthly Budget | Notes |
|------------|---------------|-------|
| Facebook/IG Ads | P15,000 - P25,000 | Focus on awareness + lead gen |
| TikTok Ads | P5,000 - P10,000 | Spark Ads on best organic content |
| Influencer Gifting | P5,000 - P10,000 | Nano/micro creators, product features |
| Total | P25,000 - P45,000/month | ~$450 - $800 USD |

**Phase 2: Early Traction (Months 4-6)**

| Allocation | Monthly Budget | Notes |
|------------|---------------|-------|
| Facebook/IG Ads | P30,000 - P60,000 | Scale winning ad sets, add retargeting |
| TikTok Ads | P10,000 - P20,000 | Scale Spark Ads, test In-Feed |
| Influencer Partnerships | P15,000 - P30,000 | Micro + mid-tier creators |
| Total | P55,000 - P110,000/month | ~$1,000 - $2,000 USD |

**Phase 3: Growth (Months 7-12)**

Reassess based on CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost), LTV, and revenue. Scale aggressively on channels with proven ROI.

---

### 7.5 Retargeting Strategy

Retargeting is where the real efficiency lives. Filipino users often need multiple touchpoints before converting.

**Retargeting Audiences:**

| Audience | Ad Message | Goal |
|----------|------------|------|
| Website visitors (did not sign up) | "Ready to start planning? Join everaftr -- it's free." | Sign-up |
| Quiz starters (did not complete) | "You're almost matched with your perfect vendor. Finish your quiz!" | Quiz completion |
| Video viewers (75%+) | "Liked what you saw? See all 80+ vendors on everaftr.ph" | Website visit |
| Page engagers (liked/commented but not followed) | "Join 1,000+ couples already in the everaftr community" | Follow + sign-up |
| Sign-ups (not active) | "Your wedding planning dashboard is waiting. Log in and explore." | Activation |

**Retargeting Budget:** Allocate 25-30% of total paid budget to retargeting. It will have the lowest cost-per-conversion.

---

## 8. Hashtag Strategy

### 8.4 Filipino Wedding Hashtags to Piggyback On

These are high-volume, existing hashtags where everaftr content should appear:

**High Volume (100K+ posts):**

|---------|--------|-------|

| #WeddingPH | High | Geographic tag. |
| #WeddingPhilippines | High | Alternate geo tag. |
| #BrideAndBreakfast | High | Competitor/media tag. Use strategically. |
| #PinoyWedding | High | Colloquial. Relatable. |
| #FilipinaaBride | Moderate-High | Gender-specific discovery. |

**Medium Volume (10K-100K posts):**

| Hashtag | Notes |
|---------|-------|
| #WeddingSuppliersPH | Vendor-focused. Good for spotlight content. |
| #WeddingVenuePH | Category-specific. |
| #WeddingPhotographerPH | Category-specific. |
| #BudgetWeddingPH | Budget content. High save rate. |

| #PinoyLoveStory | Relationship storytelling. |
| #WeddingBudgetBreakdown | Highly searched on TikTok. |
| #KasalanProblems | Relatable humor. |
| #PreCanaTips | Niche but high-intent. |
| #CENOMARGuide | Very niche, very high intent. |
| #OFWWedding | Underserved. Own this. |

### 8.5 Hashtag Usage Guidelines

| Platform | Hashtags Per Post | Placement |
|----------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Instagram Feed** | 15-20 | In the caption (after the main text, separated by line breaks) or first comment |
| **Instagram Reels** | 5-8 | In caption. Fewer but more targeted. |
| **Instagram Stories** | 1-3 | Hidden behind stickers or minimized. For discoverability. |
| **TikTok** | 3-5 | In caption. Short and targeted. TikTok's algorithm relies more on content than hashtags. |
| **Facebook** | 3-5 | End of caption. Facebook hashtags have moderate discovery value. |
| **Pinterest** | 0 | Pinterest uses keyword-rich descriptions instead of hashtags. |

## Appendix B: Competitive Social Media Landscape

| Brand | Instagram | Facebook | TikTok | Strengths | Gaps (everaftr Opportunity) |
|-------|-----------|----------|--------|-----------|---------------------------|
| **Bride and Breakfast** | Strong (editorial, aspirational) | Strong (community, events) | Growing | Beautiful content, established trust, celebrity wedding features | Skews premium/aspirational. Less accessible for budget-conscious couples. |
| **Kasal.com** | Moderate | Strong (legacy brand since 2001) | Minimal | Largest vendor directory, roadshow events, brand recognition | Dated digital experience. Not mobile-first. Weak social content. |
| **Weddings at Work** | Moderate | Active | Minimal | Content for Filipinos abroad | Narrow focus. Not a platform play. |
| **The Budgetarian Bride** | Niche | Active community | Minimal | Budget-focused, relatable | Blog-centric. No platform/tools. |

**everaftr's Social Differentiation:**
- Mobile-first platform with tools (not just a blog/directory)
- AI assistant (Kasa) -- no competitor has this
- Fiesta visual identity -- distinct from the white/blush/gold aesthetic that dominates competitors
- Budget transparency as a core content pillar (not just aspirational weddings)
- Community-first approach (not just top-down editorial)
- OFW-inclusive planning tools and content

---

## Appendix C: Key Vendor Partnership Targets for Social Content

**Priority Vendor Categories for Early Content:**

1. **Venues** (most searched, most visual) -- Partner with 5-10 venues across price ranges and locations
2. **Photographers/Videographers** (most content-rich) -- Their portfolio IS your content
3. **Caterers** (most emotional for Filipino weddings) -- Food is the #1 priority for Filipino couples
4. **Coordinators** (most expert-driven) -- Great for educational content collabs
5. **Florists/Stylists** (most visually impactful) -- Transformation content, before/after

**Partnership Ask:**
"We'd like to feature your work on everaftr's social channels (combined audience of [X]). In exchange, we'd love for you to share the feature with your followers and link to your everaftr profile. No cost -- just cross-promotion."

## Appendix D: Content Repurposing Matrix

One piece of content should live across multiple platforms in adapted formats:

| Original Content | Instagram | TikTok | Facebook Page | Facebook Group | Pinterest | Blog |
|-----------------|-----------|--------|---------------|----------------|-----------|------|
| **Wedding tip video** | Reel | Full video | Reel + text post | Discussion thread | Infographic pin | Long-form guide |
| **Vendor spotlight** | Carousel + Story | Interview clip | Photo album + link | Recommendation thread | Portfolio pins | Vendor profile page |
| **Real wedding** | Carousel feature | Highlight reel | Photo album + story | "Love Story Sunday" post | Photo pins | Full editorial |
| **Budget breakdown** | Carousel infographic | Talking head video | Long-form post | Discussion thread | Infographic pin | Calculator tool |
| **Kasa demo** | Reel + graphic | Screen recording | Video + text post | Q&A thread | -- | Feature page |
| **Meme/humor** | Reel or static | Video | Static image | Share + discussion | -- | -- |

**Rule:** Create once, adapt everywhere. Never create platform-exclusive content unless it is a platform-specific feature (e.g., Facebook Group threads, Instagram Guides).

---

## Final Notes

### Principles to Remember

1. **Filipino first.** Every piece of content should feel like it was made BY Filipinos FOR Filipinos. Not translated. Not adapted. Native.

2. **Taglish is the language.** Mix Tagalog and English naturally, the way Filipinos actually speak. "Budget breakdown ng kasal namin" not "Our Wedding Budget Breakdown" and not "Pagbabawas ng Gastusin sa Aming Kasal."

3. **Budget is not shameful.** Filipino wedding culture carries enormous financial pressure. everaftr normalizes talking about money openly. Every budget is valid.

4. **Community over content.** A perfectly designed post that nobody responds to is worth less than an ugly text post that sparks 200 comments. Prioritize conversation.

5. **Mobile-first always.** 90%+ of your audience views on Android phones. Every visual, every video, every link must work perfectly on a 6-inch screen.

6. **The fiesta never stops.** The brand energy is celebratory, warm, colorful, and alive. Even practical content (CENOMAR guides, budget tips) should feel like it comes from a friend who happens to know their stuff, not a government office.

7. **Consistency beats virality.** One viral TikTok is nice. Posting 5x/week for 6 months straight is what builds a brand. Show up every day.
