### Transcript

**Interviewer:** Thanks for sitting down with us, Marco and Pia. Congratulations on the engagement! Tell me -- how has wedding planning been going so far?

**Pia:** *(laughs)* Oh my God, where do I start? Okay, so we got engaged last December, and at first I was like, "We have so much time, relax lang." Then January came and I realized -- wait, we need to book the church. We need to do Pre-Cana. We need to get CENOMAR. And the venues in Tagaytay get booked SO fast during peak season. So we went from chill to panic mode in like two weeks.

**Marco:** Yeah, it's been... a lot. I thought it would be like project management. You know, create a timeline, assign tasks, track progress. But wedding planning is not like that at all. It's more like... managing stakeholders who all have different opinions and none of them report to you. *(Pia laughs)*

**Pia:** That is the most Marco way to describe it. But he's right. Yung mom ko has opinions about the venue. His mom has opinions about the catering. My tita wants to know why her daughter isn't a bridesmaid. His ninang from baptism is offended she wasn't asked to be a principal sponsor. It's like a corporate merger but with feelings.

**Interviewer:** That sounds intense. How are you currently managing your guest list and RSVPs?

**Pia:** Okay, this is where it gets embarrassing. So we have... *(counts on fingers)* ...a Google Sheet for the master list that Marco made. A Viber group for my side of the family. A separate Viber group for his side. A Viber group for our friends. And then I have a Notes app on my phone where I jot down names that people mention randomly -- like when my mom texts me at 10 PM saying "Ay, si Tita Linda, isama mo na rin."

**Marco:** The Google Sheet has like 14 columns. Name, relationship, which side, address, phone number, email, dietary restrictions, table assignment, RSVP status, plus-one, gift received, thank you card sent --

**Pia:** -- and literally nobody has filled it in except us. We sent the link to our parents and they were like, "Ano 'to, parang work?" So now I'm manually updating it based on Viber messages. And half the time the Viber messages are like, "Pia, si Ate Grace sabi pupunta sila with the kids, 'yung tatlo, pero 'yung bunso baka hindi, depende sa school." And I'm like... so is that 4 people or 5?

**Interviewer:** *(laughing)* That's such a real scenario. So if haraya offered an RSVP website -- a dedicated page for your wedding where guests could RSVP themselves -- what would you absolutely need on it?

**Marco:** Number one: it has to work on a phone. Like, no questions asked. Most of our guests -- especially the titos and titas -- are going to open this on their phone, probably through a Viber link. If it doesn't load fast or looks weird on mobile, they'll just close it and tell my mom "Oo, pupunta kami" instead of actually filling it out.

**Pia:** Yes! Mobile-first talaga. And it has to be simple. Like, I love beautifully designed things -- that's literally my job -- but my Tita Carmen is 58 years old and she will not figure out a complicated website. She needs: big buttons, clear text, minimal steps. Name, how many guests, are you coming, done.

**Marco:** For me, the must-haves are:
1. **Guest RSVP form** -- name, number of guests attending, dietary restrictions (because we're doing a buffet and need the headcount for the caterer)
2. **Plus-one handling** -- we need to specify who gets a plus-one and who doesn't. This is such a sensitive thing sa Filipino weddings. You can't just say "and guest" for everyone because then your 200-person guest list becomes 350
3. **Real-time dashboard** -- I want to see at a glance: how many confirmed, how many declined, how many haven't responded yet. And I want that number to be accurate because the caterer needs a final headcount 2 weeks before
4. **Automated reminders** -- people forget. I need to be able to nudge the ones who haven't responded without individually messaging each person on Viber

**Pia:** And for me, I want it to look beautiful. Like, I know that sounds superficial, but the RSVP page is the first digital impression of our wedding. I don't want it to look like a Google Form. Google Forms are for office surveys, not for the most important day of our lives.

**Marco:** Fair point.

**Pia:** I also want:
5. **Event details** -- date, time, venue with a map link (Google Maps or Waze, because everyone uses Waze in Manila), dress code
6. **Our story section** -- just a small "about us" because some of Marco's relatives haven't met me and vice versa
7. **Entourage list** -- this is very Filipino. People want to know who the ninongs and ninangs are. They want to know who's in the entourage. It's a status thing but also a "who do I know at this wedding" thing
8. **Schedule/program** -- ceremony at what time, cocktails, reception, so guests know what to expect

**Marco:** Oh, and 9. **Gift information** -- because honestly, cash gift is standard in Filipino weddings now. We need a tasteful way to say "monetary gifts are appreciated" without sounding greedy. And a GCash or bank transfer option for guests who want to send ahead.

**Pia:** *(nodding enthusiastically)* Yes! Because younger guests prefer GCash or Maya. They don't carry cash anymore. And especially for our friends abroad -- Marco has college friends in Singapore and Australia -- they can't exactly hand us an envelope at the door.

**Interviewer:** That's a great list. Now, let me ask about something we're exploring. What if the RSVP website had a "guest photographer" feature? The idea is: instead of hiring a second photographer, you let your guests contribute their photos from the celebration -- candid shots, selfies, group photos -- all uploaded to a shared album through the website.

**Pia:** *(eyes light up)* Ohhh. Okay, I actually love this concept. Because here's the thing -- we already hired a photo and video team, and they're amazing, but they can't be everywhere. Like, during the reception, our photographer is going to be focused on our table, the first dance, the cake, the sponsors' moments. But meanwhile, my college barkada is doing something funny at their table and nobody's capturing it. And those moments? Those are sometimes the best photos from a wedding. Yung candid, yung walang filter.

**Marco:** I agree, actually. Our photographer is going to do the formal shots and the artistic shots and the same-day edit video. But the guest perspective is completely different. It's like... user-generated content for your wedding. *(Pia rolls her eyes at the marketing speak)* What? It's true!

**Pia:** Sige, I'll let you have that one. But seriously, I've been to weddings where the best photos were from my friends' Instagram stories. The problem is, they disappear after 24 hours. Or they're scattered across 30 different people's phones. I always tell my friends "Send me the photos!" and like, 3 out of 15 actually do. And they send them one by one on Viber, which compresses the quality. So I end up with blurry photos.

**Marco:** The technical side of this matters to me. Upload quality is important. If guests are uploading through the website, the photos should be full resolution, not compressed like Viber or Messenger sends. And the upload process has to be dead simple. Open the website, tap "upload photo," select from gallery, done. No account creation, no login, just a link.

**Interviewer:** How would you imagine using this feature throughout the day? Would you enable it for the whole event?

**Pia:** Hmm, I'd probably want it active during specific moments:
- **Pre-ceremony** -- guests arriving, getting ready, the church setup
- **During the reception** -- table shots, candid moments, dance floor, the lechon reveal *(she laughs)*, the bouquet toss, the games
- **After-party** -- this is where the BEST candid photos happen, because everyone's relaxed and having fun

I wouldn't want it during the actual ceremony though. Like, I don't want 200 phones in the air while we're at the altar. That's what the professional photographer is for.

**Marco:** Could you control that? Like, time-based activation? "Guest photos are now open!" at a certain time?

**Interviewer:** That's definitely possible. Would you use a QR code to direct guests to the upload page?

**Marco:** QR code is perfect. We could put it:
- On the physical invitations (we're printing 80 formal invitations for the older guests)
- On a card at each table at the reception -- like a small tent card that says "Share your photos! Scan here"
- On the digital invitation we're sending through Viber

**Pia:** I love the table card idea. Because people are sitting there waiting for the food, they're bored, they see the QR code, they scan it, and suddenly they're browsing the photos other guests have taken. It becomes a fun thing at the reception.

**Marco:** Actually, that's smart. Can you imagine a live photo wall? Like, guests upload photos and they appear on a screen at the venue? That would be SO cool for the reception.

**Pia:** Oh my God, yes! We were already thinking about renting a projector for the SDE (same-day edit video). What if, before the SDE plays, the projector shows a rotating gallery of guest photos that have been uploaded? That would be such a moment.

**Interviewer:** I love that. Now let me ask -- what frustrates you about the existing solutions you've looked at for wedding websites or RSVPs?

**Pia:** Okay, so I checked out The Knot, WithJoy, and Zola. They're all so... American. Like, the templates are gorgeous, but they assume an American wedding format. "Rehearsal dinner"? We don't do that. "Registry at Target"? Walang Target dito. "Cocktail hour"? We have a cocktails AND a photobooth AND a game segment AND a money dance AND a bouquet toss. American weddings are simple compared to Filipino receptions, grabe.

**Marco:** And none of them know what a ninong is. Or a Pre-Cana. Or that you need a CENOMAR. The checklist features are useless because they're based on American wedding timelines. It's like using a template made for a different culture and trying to force it to work.

**Pia:** The other thing is -- and this is petty but it matters -- the design aesthetic of The Knot feels dated. Like it's stuck in 2015 Pinterest. Zola is better, but it still feels like it's designed for Brooklyn couples, not Tagaytay couples. I want something that feels like it was made for US. For a Filipino celebration.

**Marco:** On the technical side, WithJoy is actually pretty good functionally, but the free tier is limited and the premium is like $35/month? That's almost PHP 2,000. For a website I'll use for maybe 4-5 months.

**Pia:** And Google Forms. *(shudders)* I know so many couples who use Google Forms for RSVPs. It works, but it looks terrible. It screams "I didn't care enough to make something nice." Our wedding budget is PHP 800K -- I'm not sending guests a Google Form.

**Marco:** To be fair, Google Forms is functional. But it has zero personality. And you can't customize the URL, the look, or anything really. It's a survey tool, not a wedding tool.

**Pia:** We also tried Paperless Post for the digital invitation. It's beautiful, but it's only for the invite itself. There's no RSVP tracking, no guest management, no website. And it's expensive if you want the nice designs.

**Interviewer:** If haraya offered this as a feature -- an RSVP website with guest photography -- would you pay for it? What price feels right?

**Marco:** *(thinks)* For context, we're spending about PHP 25,000 on our printed invitations. If a digital RSVP website could replace SOME of that -- like, we'd still print formal invitations for older relatives, but we could skip printing invitations for our younger friends and just send them the website -- then the value is clear.

**Pia:** I'd pay up to PHP 1,500-2,000 for a premium RSVP website that looks beautiful, works perfectly on mobile, has the guest photographer feature, and has a custom URL. That feels like a no-brainer compared to what we're spending on everything else. But honestly? If it's a feature within a platform I'm already using for vendor discovery and planning? I'd expect a basic RSVP page to be free.

**Marco:** Yeah, freemium model makes sense. Free RSVP page with basic features. Pay for premium templates, custom domain, the guest photographer feature, live photo wall, maybe analytics on who opened the invitation.

**Pia:** Ooh, read receipts for wedding invitations? That's genius and also slightly terrifying.

**Marco:** *(grins)* I want to know who read the invite and didn't RSVP. Name and shame.

**Interviewer:** *(laughing)* Let's talk about Filipino-specific elements. What would make this feel truly made for Filipino couples?

**Pia:** Oh, I have a list:

1. **Ninong/Ninang section** -- A dedicated list of principal sponsors, cord sponsors, veil sponsors, and arrhae sponsors. This is SO important in Filipino weddings. Guests literally look at the entourage list to see who the sponsors are. It's a big deal culturally.

2. **Entourage list** -- Best man/maid of honor, groomsmen/bridesmaids, flower girl, ring bearer, Bible bearer, coin bearer. The full cast. People want to see this.

3. **Cash gift/GCash information** -- A tasteful way to indicate monetary gift preference. Maybe a small section that says something like: "Your presence is the greatest gift, but for those who wish to give, monetary gifts are lovingly appreciated." And then show GCash number, Maya number, and bank transfer details. This is STANDARD in Filipino weddings now but none of the international platforms support it.

4. **Dress code with Filipino context** -- When we say "semi-formal," Filipino guests need to know: does that mean Barong Tagalog for men? Filipiniana for women? Are jeans okay? Can I wear shorts? *(She's clearly been asked this)* The dress code section should have Filipino-specific options like "Barong Tagalog / Filipiniana," "Smart Casual," "Formal / Evening Wear."

5. **Waze/Google Maps integration** -- Venue location with a "Navigate" button that opens Waze directly. Because Google Maps is fine but EVERY Filipino driver uses Waze. And for Tagaytay weddings, the directions matter because some venues are hidden down little roads.

6. **Multiple event support** -- Filipino Catholic weddings often have: the church ceremony AND the reception at a different venue. Some couples also have a pamanhikan, a despedida (bachelorette), a rehearsal. The website should support multiple events with different locations and times.

**Marco:** And on the technical side:
7. **Viber share optimization** -- When you share the URL on Viber, it should show a beautiful preview card. Proper OG tags, a nice image, the couple's name. Because 90% of our guests will receive this link through Viber.
8. **Offline capability** -- 4G in the Philippines can be spotty. If a guest opens the site at the venue and the signal is weak, the page should still load from cache. Even if they can't upload photos at that exact moment, the RSVP and event details should be accessible.

**Interviewer:** What about privacy? With the guest photographer feature, who should be able to see and download the photos?

**Pia:** This is actually a big concern. Okay, so here's the thing -- Tito Jun takes photos at every family event and they are... not great. I love my Tito Jun, but his photos are always blurry, badly lit, and he always catches people mid-chew. *(Marco is dying laughing)*

**Marco:** It's true. Every family event, Tito Jun posts an album of 200 photos on Facebook and tags everyone. And you can't untag yourself because then it's rude.

**Pia:** SO. I would want some level of moderation. Not full approval -- that's too much work on my wedding day -- but maybe:
- **After the event**, Marco and I can review all uploaded photos and "hide" ones we don't want in the shared album. Not delete, just hide.
- **Download rights** -- I'd want full-resolution downloads available to us (the couple), but maybe lower-res for guests to download. We paid for this feature; we should own the high-quality versions.
- **No auto-posting to social media.** I don't want the photos automatically shared on Facebook or Instagram. The couple should decide when and what to share publicly.
- **Gallery visibility** -- maybe the gallery is only visible to people who have RSVP'd? Or people who have the QR code? Not fully public. I don't want random strangers seeing our wedding photos.

**Marco:** I'd add: **photo attribution**. If a guest uploads a photo, their name should be attached to it. Not publicly visible in the gallery necessarily, but available to us. So if there's an amazing photo, we know who took it and we can thank them personally.

**Pia:** Oh, and one more thing -- **watermark option**. Not on the guest photos themselves, but on the gallery page. A small, tasteful "Marco & Pia | November 15, 2026 | Captured with love by our guests" footer or something. Just so it feels curated, not random.

**Interviewer:** How would you share the QR code and website link with your guests? Walk me through it.

**Pia:** Okay, so our guest list has basically three tiers:

**Tier 1: Formal printed invitations** (~80 guests) -- These go to older relatives, principal sponsors (ninongs/ninangs), VIPs. These are the ones my mom insists on printing because "it's proper." The printed invitation would have a QR code on the back or on a small insert card that says "RSVP & more details: scan here" or "Visit: marco-and-pia.haraya.ph"

**Tier 2: Digital invitations via Viber** (~100 guests) -- Our friends and younger relatives. We'd design a beautiful digital invitation (probably using Canva or the haraya template) and send it with the link directly. "Hey! You're invited to our wedding! RSVP here: [link]" in our Viber groups and individual chats.

**Tier 3: Word of mouth + follow-up** (~20 guests) -- These are the random additions. The people my mom adds last minute. "Ay, si Aling Rosa, invite mo na rin." For these, I'd just send them the link directly.

**Marco:** At the venue itself:
- **Welcome table** -- A printed sign with the QR code and "Share your photos! Scan to upload" instruction
- **Table tent cards** -- Small cards on each table with the QR code
- **Maybe on the cocktails screen** -- If we have a TV/projector during the cocktails, the QR code can be displayed there

**Pia:** I also think the emcee should announce it. Like, during the reception: "By the way, couples Marco and Pia want YOU to be their photographers tonight! Scan the QR code on your table to upload your favorite moments to their wedding album." That would be so fun.

**Interviewer:** That's brilliant. What about the nice-to-haves? Things that aren't essential but would make you go "wow"?

**Pia:** Ooh, okay:

1. **Live photo counter** -- A ticker on the website showing "157 photos shared so far!" Creates excitement and social proof.
2. **Background music on the RSVP page** -- Controversial, I know. But a soft, auto-play (muted by default, option to turn on) soundtrack of our song? *Chef's kiss.*
3. **Countdown timer** -- Days until the wedding. It's basic but it makes the page feel alive.
4. **Love story timeline** -- An interactive timeline of our relationship milestones. First date, first trip, engagement. With photos. Our guests would EAT this up. Filipinos are hopeless romantics.
5. **Photo filters** -- What if guests could apply a wedding-themed filter to their photos before uploading? Like a subtle "Marco & Pia" watermark or a dreamy filter that matches the wedding aesthetic.

**Marco:** My nice-to-haves are more functional:

1. **Table assignment viewer** -- Guest logs in, sees their table number. No more crowding around a seating chart.
2. **Parking information** -- Our venue in Alfonso has limited parking. A map showing parking areas would be useful.
3. **Shuttle schedule** -- We're running shuttle buses from a meeting point in Tagaytay to the venue. If the website showed the schedule, it'd save me from answering 50 Viber messages about it.
4. **Weather widget** -- For garden weddings in November, weather is a legit concern. A little weather forecast for the wedding day would be useful (even if it's just a link to AccuWeather).
5. **Export functionality** -- Let me export the RSVP data to Excel. I need to give the final headcount to the caterer, the final seating chart to the coordinator, and the contact list to my mom.

**Interviewer:** Last question -- how are you currently managing RSVPs? What's the process?

**Marco:** *(sighs)* It's chaos. Basically:

1. We send the invitation (printed or digital)
2. Guest receives it
3. Guest tells ONE family member they're coming
4. That family member tells another family member
5. Eventually my mom calls me and says "Ah si Tita Lorna, pupunta sila, apat sila"
6. I update the Google Sheet
7. Two weeks later, Tita Lorna changes her mind -- "dalawa na lang pala, 'yung anak niya may exam"
8. I update the Google Sheet again
9. Repeat 200 times

**Pia:** And then there are the people who NEVER respond. You don't know if they're coming or not. You can't call them because that feels awkward. You can't NOT prepare for them because what if they show up? So you end up budgeting for 220 people just to be safe, which costs extra money.

**Marco:** Our caterer charges PHP 650 per head. An extra 20 people is PHP 13,000 we might not need to spend. But we can't risk not having enough food because that would be mortifying. "Walang pagkain sa kasal ni Marco" -- that story would follow me forever.

**Pia:** *(grabbing Marco's arm)* SEE, this is exactly why we need something better! If there was a website where each guest could just tap "Yes, I'm coming, I'm bringing 2 guests" and it automatically updated a dashboard -- it would save us literally WEEKS of Viber tag.

**Interviewer:** What would make you recommend haraya's RSVP feature to other couples?

**Pia:** If it looked beautiful, was easy to use, and had Filipino-specific features that international platforms don't have -- ninong/ninang list, GCash integration, Viber-optimized sharing, Filipino dress code options -- I would tell EVERYONE. I'm in three wedding planning Viber groups and two Facebook groups. If I found a platform that actually understood Filipino weddings? I'd be posting about it everywhere.

**Marco:** For me, it's about saving time and reducing stress. If the RSVP website saved me from updating that Google Sheet 200 times, I'd pay for it and recommend it. Couples talk to each other. When one couple finds something that works, the whole friend group adopts it. That's how Filipino social networks work.

**Pia:** Oh, one more thing -- if the website was beautiful enough that I could share a screenshot on my Instagram story and it would make people go "Saan 'yan? What platform is that?" -- that's free marketing for haraya. Make it Instagram-worthy and your users become your marketers.

**Marco:** Facts.

### Transcript

**Interviewer:** Sam and Alex, thanks for making time for this. I know you're deep in planning mode with the celebration just 6 weeks away. How are things going?

**Alex:** *(laughs)* "Deep in planning mode" is an understatement. I think I've been in planning mode for three months straight. But honestly? It's been fun. Stressful, but fun. We're doing things our way, which makes it feel more personal.

**Sam:** Yeah, one of the advantages of not having a traditional church wedding is that there's less... institutional structure? Like, we don't have to worry about Pre-Cana or getting 18 pairs of ninongs who all have to be Catholic and married. Our ceremony is at City Hall -- it takes 30 minutes. The real event is the party after.

**Alex:** And the party is going to be amazing. We rented a boutique event space in BGC -- it's this loft-style venue with exposed brick and industrial lighting. Very us. We're doing cocktail-style, no formal sit-down dinner. Amazing food, great music, open bar, photo stations. That's the vibe.

**Interviewer:** Love it. So tell me -- how are you currently handling RSVPs?

**Sam:** *(cringing)* Google Forms. I know, I know. I literally design user interfaces for a living and I'm using Google Forms for my own wedding RSVPs. But here's the thing -- it works. It collects the data, it puts it in a spreadsheet, and it's free. I just... hate how it looks.

**Alex:** It's so ugly, babe. I'm sorry, but it's ugly. Every time someone opens our Google Form, they see that purple header with the default font and I die a little inside. We spent weeks designing our digital invitation on Canva -- it's gorgeous, very on-brand for us -- and then the RSVP link takes them to... a Google Form. It's like wearing a couture outfit with rubber slippers.

**Sam:** *(laughing)* That's the most Alex analogy ever. But true. The invitation is beautiful. It has our engagement photos, our color palette -- we went with sage green and warm neutrals -- our story, the event details. And then at the bottom: "RSVP here" and it links to a Google Form that looks like a homework assignment.

**Interviewer:** If you could have a dedicated RSVP website instead, what would you want on it?

**Sam:** Okay, so as a UX designer, I have Opinions. *(Alex nods knowingly)* Here's what I'd want:

1. **A single URL that IS the wedding website AND the RSVP.** I don't want a separate invitation, a separate website, and a separate RSVP form. I want ONE link that has everything: our story, event details, RSVP form, photo gallery. One link to rule them all.

2. **A clean, modern, customizable design.** I want to be able to choose colors, fonts, layout. Not from 500 templates that all look the same -- I mean real customization. Let me pick my accent color, choose between 3-4 layouts, upload my own engagement photos as the hero image.

3. **The RSVP form integrated into the page.** Not a separate link, not a pop-up, not a redirect. The form should be right there on the page. Scroll down past the details, and there's the RSVP section. Seamless.

4. **Guest management that understands our situation.** So here's where it gets real for us. We're an LGBTQ+ couple. Not all of our guests know about our relationship. Some of Alex's more conservative relatives know Alex is coming to "an event" but don't know it's our civil ceremony. So privacy matters. We need to be able to control who sees what.

**Alex:** *(nodding seriously)* Yeah, this is important. So for context -- my parents are supportive. My siblings are supportive. But I have some older relatives who... it's complicated. They know about Sam but they don't fully understand or accept it. We're inviting them because they're family and we love them, but we also know that seeing photos of our ceremony on social media before they've processed it in person could cause drama.

**Sam:** So for the RSVP website, we'd want:
- **Privacy controls** -- who can see the photo gallery? Can we make it visible only to people who have the link? Or even only to people who have RSVP'd?
- **No auto-share to Facebook.** This is huge. None of those "Share on Facebook!" buttons that international platforms love. We control when and how our celebration goes public.
- **No gendered language anywhere.** If the website says "bride and groom" even once, we're out. We've been burned by wedding platforms before. We tried The Knot to look at vendors and literally every template said "bride and groom." WithJoy at least lets you change it, but the default is still "bride and groom" and some of the templates still have gendered placeholder text. It's exhausting.

**Alex:** What I want is a platform where I don't have to "fix" things. I don't want to go through every section and change "bride" to something else. I want the default to already be inclusive. Like, if the RSVP form says "Your name" and "Number of guests" -- great. If the website template says "Join us for our celebration" instead of "Join us for the wedding of Mr. and Mrs." -- great. That's the baseline. I shouldn't have to fight for it.

**Interviewer:** That's a core principle of haraya. The default is inclusive -- "You" and "Your Partner." No assumptions. How does that land with you?

**Sam:** *(visible relief)* That's... exactly what we want. Honestly, even the way you said that -- "You and Your Partner" -- feels right. It's warm. It's personal. It doesn't sound clinical like "Partner 1 and Partner 2." And it doesn't sound heteronormative like "Bride and Groom." It just sounds like... a couple. Which is what we are.

**Alex:** If haraya does that by default, that alone would be a reason to use it over every other platform. I'm not exaggerating. The number of wedding planning things that have made me feel othered is... a lot. And it's usually not malicious -- it's just that nobody thought about us when they designed it. If haraya actually thinks about us from the start? Take my money.

**Interviewer:** Let's talk about the guest photographer feature. As a photographer yourself, Alex, how do you feel about having guests contribute photos?

**Alex:** *(grins)* Okay, so here's where I have a unique perspective. I'm a photographer. I've shot weddings. I know what professional photos look like. And I ALSO know that some of the most emotionally powerful photos at any event are the ones taken by guests on their phones.

Here's why: a hired photographer captures the event. They get the posed shots, the ceremony moments, the decor, the details. But guests capture the RELATIONSHIPS. A tita taking a selfie with her favorite niece. A college friend capturing the exact moment the couple sees each other. A kid sneaking a photo of the lechon. Those aren't "professional quality" photos, but they're full of love and context that a hired photographer can never replicate.

**Sam:** Also, real talk -- we're on a budget. We hired one photographer (a friend who's giving us a huge discount) for the civil ceremony and the first 2 hours of the party. After that, we're on our own. So the guest photographer feature would literally fill the gap for the rest of the evening.

**Alex:** And I think it's actually perfect for our type of celebration. We're doing a cocktail-style party with no formal program. People are going to be mingling, dancing, eating, hanging out. It's not a structured reception where you know what happens when. So having guests capture moments throughout the night -- and being able to see them all in one place -- would be amazing.

**Interviewer:** How would you want the guest photo upload experience to work?

**Sam:** UX designer hat on:

1. **QR code at the venue** -- one scan, opens the upload page in their browser. No app download. No login. No sign-up. Just: scan, tap "upload," select photos, done. Three taps maximum.

2. **Bulk upload** -- guests should be able to select multiple photos at once, not one by one. That's a dealbreaker. If I have to tap "upload" for each photo individually, I'll give up after the third one.

3. **Instant preview** -- after uploading, I want to see my photos in the gallery immediately. It should feel instant, not "your photos are being processed, check back later."

4. **Name tag, not account** -- just ask "What's your name?" before the upload. That way the couple knows who contributed what. No email, no password, no account creation. Just a name.

**Alex:** And from a creative perspective:

5. **NO mandatory filters.** Please. Let me upload my photo as-is. If I took a good photo, I don't want a cheesy "wedding frame" plastered on it. Optional filters or borders? Sure. Mandatory? No.

6. **Gallery layout** -- I'd want the gallery to look like a mood board, not a generic grid. Something with varying sizes, like a magazine layout or a Pinterest board. Not just rows of thumbnails.

7. **Photo quality** -- maintain the original resolution. I shoot with a Pixel 8 Pro and the photos are 50 megapixels. If the platform compresses them to Instagram quality, what's the point?

8. **Video support** -- short clips too. 15-30 second videos of the party, the toast, the first dance. Not just static photos. This is where the real magic is.

**Interviewer:** What about moderation? You mentioned privacy is important. How would you handle photos you don't want in the gallery?

**Alex:** So I've been the photographer at events where guests take photos that are... not great. Bad lighting, unflattering angles, blurry, or just embarrassing. Like, someone catches you mid-sneeze and uploads it. I would want:

- **Post-event curation.** After the party, Sam and I sit down together and go through ALL the uploaded photos. We star the ones we love, hide the ones we don't want visible, and the curated gallery is what guests see when they visit the website later.
- **"Report" button for guests** -- not for moderating content, but so a guest can flag their own photo if they uploaded it by accident or don't like how they look in it. Basically: "Hey, can you remove this?" request that comes to us.
- **No download until we approve.** The raw uploads should only be downloadable by us (the couple) initially. Once we curate the gallery, then guests can download the approved photos. This prevents the Tito Jun situation where terrible photos spread before you can do anything about it.

**Sam:** *(laughing)* Oh God, my Tito Jun equivalent is my Tita Baby. She takes photos of EVERYTHING and posts them on Facebook with no filter and full brightness. If she uploads 200 photos of people eating, I want to be able to quietly hide 195 of them.

**Alex:** *(to interviewer)* Every Filipino family has a Tito Jun or Tita Baby. It's universal.

**Interviewer:** What about your experience with existing wedding website platforms?

**Sam:** So I tried the following:

**The Knot:** Gorgeous templates but very American. "Bride and Groom" everywhere. "Mr. and Mrs. [Last Name]." "Registry at Crate & Barrel." Hard pass. Also, the free tier has very limited customization and it shows ads. On YOUR wedding website. No.

**WithJoy:** Better -- you can change the labels and it's less gendered. But the design is... fine? It's not ugly but it's not distinctive. Every WithJoy website looks like every other WithJoy website. And the premium features are priced in USD which stings when you convert to PHP.

**Zola:** Best design of the three but EXTREMELY American. The "registry" feature is the centerpiece and it's useless for Filipino weddings. We don't do gift registries. We do cash gifts. Zola doesn't understand that. Also, Zola's RSVP system asks for mailing addresses -- mailing address! -- because they assume you'll be sending thank-you cards by mail. Sino ba nag-me-mail ngayon?

**Joy by Paperless Post:** Beautiful invitations but it's a one-way thing -- you send the invite, that's it. No ongoing website, no guest management, no photo sharing.

**Canva:** We used Canva for our digital invitation design and it was great for that. But Canva is a design tool, not a wedding planning tool. You design a beautiful image and then... you share it on Viber as a .jpg. That's it. No RSVP, no interaction, no data collection.

**Alex:** What I really want is the design quality of Canva, the functionality of WithJoy, the cultural awareness of... well, nobody currently does this well. And the inclusivity of a platform that was built for US from day one. Not retrofitted. Not "we added a 'same-sex' option" as an afterthought. Built for us.

**Interviewer:** What Filipino-specific elements would matter for your celebration website?

**Sam:** So our celebration is a bit different from a traditional Filipino wedding. We don't have ninongs and ninangs because it's a civil ceremony. We don't have an entourage in the traditional sense. But we DO have Filipino-specific needs:

1. **GCash/Maya/bank transfer info** -- This is non-negotiable. Cash gifts are the norm in Filipino celebrations, and for our guests, most of them will want to send via GCash or Maya. We need a clean, tasteful section for this. Not a giant "SEND US MONEY" banner -- something elegant, like a small section at the bottom that says "If you'd like to give a gift, here's how."

2. **Viber-optimized sharing** -- When I share the link in our Viber groups, it needs to show a beautiful preview. Proper Open Graph image, our names, the date, a snippet of text. Not a broken link or a generic thumbnail. First impressions matter, even in a Viber chat.

3. **Tagalog/English flexibility** -- We'd write our website in English, but we'd love the option to add Tagalog or Taglish copy. Like, our "About Us" section might be in English, but the "How We Met" story has some moments that are just funnier in Tagalog. Mixed language support matters.

4. **Food preference section on RSVP** -- Filipino celebrations always have food debates. We're doing a cocktail-style buffet with stations, and we want to ask guests about dietary restrictions and preferences -- not just "vegetarian or not" but specifically: "Do you eat pork?" because we're serving lechon belly and some of our Muslim friends don't eat pork. Philippine-specific dietary awareness.

5. **Custom event labeling** -- Our day has three parts: the civil ceremony (small, private -- only parents and witnesses), the cocktails & dinner party (the main event for all guests), and the after-party (dance floor, drinks, close friends). I want to be able to name these however I want. Not "ceremony" and "reception" -- those are traditional wedding terms. Ours are "The Promise" (civil ceremony), "The Celebration" (dinner party), and "The After" (after-party). Let us name them.

**Alex:** 6. **Photo/video slideshow of our relationship** -- Filipinos LOVE a love story. At every wedding I've shot, the crowd goes wild for the love story montage. We want a section on the website -- maybe an interactive timeline -- showing key moments of our 6 years together. First date at a coffee shop in Poblacion. First trip to El Nido. When we adopted our dog, Tofu. These moments tell our story better than any paragraph.

7. **Music recommendation** -- Can guests suggest songs for the party playlist? We're not doing a traditional program with formal dances and bouquet toss. We're doing a party. If guests could submit song requests through the website before the event, our DJ could build a setlist that actually represents our people. That would be amazing.

**Interviewer:** Would you pay for premium features?

**Sam:** Here's my honest take. We're on a PHP 400K budget. Every peso matters. For a basic RSVP page that looks decent and collects responses -- that should be free. I'll say it again: that should be free. It's table stakes. It's the minimum viable product. You cannot charge for a basic RSVP form in 2026.

BUT. If haraya offered:
- Custom URL (sam-and-alex.haraya.ph)
- Beautiful design templates that I can customize
- Guest photographer feature
- Photo gallery with moderation
- Video support in the gallery
- Song request feature
- Real-time RSVP dashboard
- Export to spreadsheet
- Custom domain support

...I would absolutely pay PHP 999-1,499 for a 6-month subscription. That covers my entire planning period. It's less than what we're spending on our invitation design. And the value is massive.

**Alex:** I'd go up to PHP 1,500 if the design is genuinely beautiful and Instagram-worthy. If I'm proud to share the link. If when my friends open it, they go "Ang ganda naman nito, saan 'to?" If it reflects us. That's worth paying for.

**Sam:** What I would NOT pay for: a basic RSVP form, a generic template I can't customize, or anything that looks like a Google Form with lipstick on it. The premium has to be premium.

**Interviewer:** What about sharing the QR code? How do you envision that?

**Alex:** So we're not doing printed invitations at all. Everything is digital. Here's our distribution plan:

1. **Digital invitation on Viber** -- Our main Canva-designed invitation image, with the haraya RSVP link at the bottom. Sent to individual chats and group chats. This reaches about 70% of our guests.

2. **Instagram Story** -- A "save the date" story post with the link. This reaches our wider social circle and also serves as a soft announcement for people who might not be invited. (Yes, that's a thing. People check if they're invited by seeing if the RSVP link works for them.)

3. **At the venue** -- QR code displayed at the entrance, at the bar, and maybe as part of the table centerpieces. Since it's cocktail-style, people will be moving around, so the QR code should be visible in multiple locations.

4. **On the welcome screen** -- We're having a digital welcome screen at the entrance. The QR code for guest photos would be right there, big and clear: "Be our photographer tonight! Scan to share your moments."

**Sam:** I also think a NFC tap would be cool. Like a little NFC tag on the table that you tap with your phone and it takes you directly to the upload page. But maybe that's too techy for some of our older guests.

**Alex:** Babe, our guests are 80 people and most of them are under 35. I think they can handle NFC.

**Sam:** Fair point. Our guest list skews young and tech-savvy. But still, QR codes are the universal standard. Everyone knows how to scan a QR code now, post-pandemic.

**Interviewer:** What would make you recommend haraya to other couples getting married?

**Sam:** If it's the platform that made me feel SEEN. Every other wedding planning tool made me feel like I had to adapt to it. Change the labels. Ignore the gendered templates. Skip the sections that don't apply. Work around the platform's assumptions. If haraya is the platform that adapts to ME -- that starts with inclusive defaults, understands Filipino celebrations, and doesn't make me feel like an edge case -- I would tell literally everyone.

**Alex:** *(emphatically)* And our community talks. The LGBTQ+ community in Manila is tight. If one couple finds a platform that genuinely works for them, EVERYONE knows about it within weeks. There's an Instagram account -- I won't name it -- that curates LGBTQ+ wedding content in the Philippines, and it has like 40K followers. If we had a great experience with haraya and posted about it, that's 40K impressions right there.

**Sam:** But it's not just the LGBTQ+ angle. It's about quality. If the platform is genuinely good -- beautiful, functional, Filipino, modern -- our straight friends would use it too. Our friends Jen and Marco are getting married in November *(editor's note: different Marco from Interview 1)* and Jen is constantly asking us for planning tips because she knows we're organized. If we recommended haraya, she'd check it out in a heartbeat.

**Alex:** The best endorsement for any product is when someone says "We used it for our wedding and it was perfect." That's the Philippine wedding recommendation economy. It's word of mouth. It's "sino vendor mo?" at every family gathering. If haraya becomes the answer to "anong platform ginamit niyo?" -- game over. You win.

**Interviewer:** Before we wrap up -- is there anything else you'd want us to know about how you plan or what would make the RSVP experience better?

**Sam:** One thing: meal preference tracking. I mentioned it briefly, but I want to emphasize this. We have friends who are:
- Vegetarian
- Halal (Muslim friends who don't eat pork)
- Have seafood allergies
- Keto (yes, even at our wedding)

Our caterer needs to know this. The RSVP form should let guests specify dietary restrictions with Filipino-relevant options -- not just "vegetarian / vegan / gluten-free" like American platforms do. Add "No pork (halal)" and "Seafood allergy" specifically. These are common in the Philippines with our Muslim and allergy-prone population.

**Alex:** And one design thing: please, for the love of God, let us change the fonts. I know Playfair Display and Poppins are haraya's brand fonts, and they're beautiful, but for OUR celebration website, we might want something different. Maybe a handwritten-style font for the headings. Maybe something bolder. Let the couple express their own identity within the platform's framework. Don't force your brand aesthetic on our wedding. The platform should fade into the background -- the couple's personality should shine through.

**Sam:** *(nods)* The best platforms are invisible. You don't notice the platform -- you notice the couple's story. haraya should be the canvas, not the painting.

**Alex:** That's so good. Put that on a slide.

**Sam:** *(laughing)* Can I invoice you for that tagline?

**Alex:** You can invoice haraya, not me.

## Cross-Interview Analysis: Patterns and Product Implications

### Universal Needs (Both Couples)

| Need | Evidence | Product Implication |
|------|----------|-------------------|
| **Mobile-first, no friction** | Both couples emphasized mobile-first design and simple UX for guests of all ages | The RSVP and photo upload must work flawlessly on mobile browsers -- no app download, no account creation |
| **Beautiful design** | Both couples rejected Google Forms and generic templates; both want Instagram-worthy quality | Design is not a nice-to-have -- it IS the product. The RSVP page is the digital first impression of the couple's celebration |
| **GCash/Maya integration** | Both couples mentioned monetary gifts via GCash as standard in Filipino celebrations | A dedicated "Gifts" section with GCash QR code, Maya number, and bank details is essential |
| **Viber optimization** | Both couples distribute links primarily through Viber | OG tags, preview images, and short URLs must be optimized for Viber's link preview rendering |
| **Privacy controls** | Both couples want control over photo visibility, no auto-sharing, and post-event moderation | Build with privacy by default: link-only access, no social media auto-sharing, couple moderation tools |
| **RSVP dashboard** | Both couples are frustrated with manual headcount tracking | Real-time dashboard with confirmed/pending/declined is core functionality |
| **Cultural relevance** | Both couples felt unseen by international platforms | Filipino-specific features (ninong lists, Filipino dress codes, halal dietary options, multiple venue support) are differentiators |
| **Word-of-mouth as growth** | Both couples described how Filipino couples recommend platforms to each other | Product-led growth: beautiful, shareable, screenshot-worthy design drives organic acquisition |

### Differences Worth Noting

| Dimension | Marco & Pia (Catholic, 200 guests) | Sam & Alex (Civil, 80 guests) |
|-----------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Ceremony complexity** | Multi-part: church + reception + multiple sponsors | Simple: City Hall ceremony + party |
| **Ninong/Ninang need** | Essential -- 18 pairs of sponsors, entourage list is a status display | Not relevant for civil ceremony |
| **Guest photographer use** | Supplement to hired photographer; moments between formal shots | Fill the gap after photographer leaves; covers entire evening |
| **Printed invitations** | Yes for older relatives (~80 printed, rest digital) | None -- 100% digital distribution |
| **Inclusivity sensitivity** | Appreciated but not a primary driver | Core requirement; will choose/reject platform based on this |
| **Privacy concern type** | Photo quality moderation (unflattering photos) | Identity safety (who knows about the relationship) |
| **Budget sensitivity** | Would pay up to PHP 2,000 comfortably | More price-conscious; wants free tier, would pay PHP 999-1,499 for premium |
| **Event structure** | Traditional: ceremony, cocktails, reception, program | Non-traditional: promise, celebration, after-party (custom naming) |
| **Design preference** | Filipino-wedding-beautiful (dreamy, romantic) | Modern-creative-clean (couples' own identity should dominate) |
| **Tech sophistication** | High -- but thinking about less tech-savvy guests (Tita Carmen) | Very high -- both work in tech/creative fields, younger guest list |

### Pricing Strategy Implications

| Tier | Features | Price Point (Suggested) |
|------|----------|----------------------|
| **Free** | Basic RSVP page, event details, simple guest list, one photo, mobile-responsive, haraya branding | PHP 0 |
| **Premium** | Custom URL (couple.haraya.ph), custom colors/fonts, guest photographer, photo gallery with moderation, video uploads, GCash/gift section, ninong/ninang section, RSVP dashboard with export, automated reminders, multiple events, remove haraya branding | PHP 999 - 1,499 (one-time or 6-month) |
| **Ultimate** | Everything in Premium + custom domain, live photo wall (projector integration), NFC tag support, unlimited storage, song request feature, love story timeline, table assignments, analytics, priority support | PHP 1,999 - 2,499 |

### Feature Priority Matrix (Combined)
