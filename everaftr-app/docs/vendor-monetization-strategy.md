## 1. Executive Summary

everaftr has a rare window to become the default digital marketplace for the PHP 74B-207B Philippine wedding industry. With 370,000-415,000 weddings per year, no dominant platform, and couples currently relying on scam-prone Facebook groups, the opportunity is massive and time-sensitive.

This document outlines a four-tier vendor monetization model calibrated specifically for the Philippine market, where:

- The average wedding costs PHP 335,000
- Individual vendor packages range from PHP 5,000 (budget makeup) to PHP 500,000+ (premium venues/caterers)
- Wedding fair booth fees run PHP 15,000-50,000 for a two-day event with no guaranteed leads
- Filipino SMEs are price-sensitive but value ROI when it is clearly demonstrated
- Facebook is both the incumbent "platform" and the primary source of vendor fraud (PHP 13M+ lost in recent Cebu scam alone)

**Core pricing philosophy:** Make the free tier genuinely useful (not crippled), so vendors stay and build profiles. Monetize through visibility, not access. Vendors pay to be *seen more*, not to *exist*.

**Year 1 revenue target (moderate):** PHP 4.8M (approximately USD 86,000)

## 2. Market Context & Competitive Landscape

### 2.1 Why Now

The Philippine wedding industry has no equivalent of The Knot, WeddingWire, or Zola. The current landscape:

| Platform | Type | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|----------|------|-----------|------------|
| **Bride and Breakfast** (brideandbreakfast.ph) | Blog + directory | 453K FB followers, strong content, est. 2010, DA 54 | Content-first, not transactional; no vendor tools; no inquiry tracking; static listings |
| **Nuptials.ph** | Blog + directory | Good SEO, photo/video pricing guides | Blog with directory bolted on; no vendor dashboard; no lead management |
| **EventNest.ph** | Supplier directory | Covers Metro Manila to Davao; clean UI | Thin vendor profiles; no booking/inquiry system; no vendor analytics |
| **Bridestory** (bridestory.com/philippines) | Regional marketplace | 27,000 vendors across SEA; Tokopedia-backed | Indonesia-centric; Philippine coverage is thin; not localized for Filipino couples |
| **Facebook Groups** | Social/unstructured | Massive reach; free to post | Zero vetting; rampant scams (PHP 11M+ Cebu case); no search/filter; vendor spam; no analytics |
| **Wedding Fairs** (Wedding Library, Themes & Motifs) | Physical events | Face-to-face trust; 350+ vendors per event | PHP 15K-50K per booth; only reaches walk-in couples; 2-day window; no digital trail |

### 2.2 everaftr's Structural Advantages

- **80 real vendors already onboarded** across 8 categories -- this is a foundation, not a cold start
- **Inclusive positioning** -- first platform to explicitly welcome LGBTQ+ couples, which is a meaningful differentiator in a conservative market and attracts progressive vendors and couples
- **Multi-city coverage** from Day 1 (Metro Manila, Tagaytay, Cebu, Davao, Pampanga, Batangas, Iloilo, Boracay, Baguio)
- **No dominant digital competitor** to unseat -- the market is fragmented across blogs, Facebook, and physical fairs

### 2.3 Pricing Benchmark: What Vendors Already Spend

To set pricing that vendors will actually pay, here is what they currently spend on marketing:

| Marketing Channel | Cost | What They Get |
|-------------------|------|---------------|
| Wedding fair booth (single event) | PHP 15,000-50,000 | 2 days of foot traffic; no guaranteed leads |
| Facebook/Instagram ads (monthly) | PHP 3,000-15,000 | Reach, but low-quality clicks; no booking intent signal |
| Bride and Breakfast feature | PHP 5,000-20,000 (estimated) | Single article/feature; decays over time |
| Google Business Profile | Free | Basic visibility, but not wedding-specific |
| Word of mouth | Free | Powerful but unscalable |

**Key insight:** If everaftr charges PHP 1,500-5,000/month and delivers 5-15 qualified inquiries, it will be dramatically cheaper than a wedding fair booth and more targeted than Facebook ads. The value proposition is clear.

---

## 3. Vendor Segmentation

Before pricing, we must understand who is paying and what they value. Philippine wedding vendors fall into four distinct segments:

### Segment A: Solo/Micro Vendors (40% of market)
- **Profile:** Solo photographer, freelance makeup artist, independent florist, one-person coordination team
- **Annual revenue:** PHP 300,000-1,200,000
- **Marketing budget:** PHP 0-5,000/month (mostly organic social media)
- **Pain points:** Can't afford wedding fairs; invisible outside personal networks; lose leads to bigger competitors; no portfolio site
- **What they value:** Any visibility at all; their first professional web presence; credibility signals (verified badge, reviews)
- **Price sensitivity:** Very high -- PHP 500/month feels significant

### Segment B: Established Small Business (35% of market)
- **Profile:** Small studio (2-5 team), established caterer, mid-range venue, professional styling team
- **Annual revenue:** PHP 1,200,000-5,000,000
- **Marketing budget:** PHP 5,000-20,000/month
- **Pain points:** Waste time on unqualified Facebook inquiries; attend 2-4 fairs/year at PHP 15K-50K each; need a way to stand out from cheaper competitors
- **What they value:** Qualified leads (couples who match their price range); portfolio showcase; review management; data on what is working
- **Price sensitivity:** Moderate -- will pay if ROI is demonstrable

### Segment C: Premium/Regional Leaders (20% of market)
- **Profile:** Well-known in their city or niche; multi-service providers; have a team of 5-20; recognized brand
- **Annual revenue:** PHP 5,000,000-20,000,000
- **Marketing budget:** PHP 20,000-50,000+/month
- **Pain points:** Brand dilution from being listed alongside budget vendors; need to filter out inquiries that do not match their price floor; want exclusivity signals
- **What they value:** Premium placement that signals prestige; lead quality filtering; featured content; analytics; competitive intelligence
- **Price sensitivity:** Low -- will pay for exclusivity and quality

### Segment D: Celebrity/Luxury Tier (5% of market)
- **Profile:** Jason Magbanua, Francis Libiran, Juan Carlo, top-tier Metro Manila venues
- **Annual revenue:** PHP 20,000,000+
- **Marketing budget:** PHP 50,000+/month (often have in-house marketing teams)
- **Pain points:** Don't need leads -- they need brand presence and editorial control; want to be on the platform but on their own terms
- **What they value:** Brand association with a premium platform; editorial features; curated placement; full control over their profile
- **Price sensitivity:** Zero -- but they will not pay if the platform does not feel premium

## 4. Tiered Pricing Model

### Overview

| Tier | Name | Monthly Price | Annual Price | Target Segment | Goal |
|------|------|---------------|--------------|----------------|------|
| 1 | **Libre** (Free) | PHP 0 | PHP 0 | Segment A (Solo/Micro) | Build supply; fill out the marketplace |
| 2 | **Pundar** (Featured) | PHP 1,499/mo | PHP 14,990/yr (save 17%) | Segment B (Established Small) | First revenue tier; volume play |
| 3 | **Pangunahin** (Premium) | PHP 3,999/mo | PHP 39,990/yr (save 17%) | Segment C (Regional Leaders) | Core revenue driver |
| 4 | **Natatangi** (Exclusive) | PHP 9,999/mo | PHP 99,990/yr (save 17%) | Segment D (Celebrity/Luxury) | Prestige tier; strategic partnerships |

*Tier names use Filipino words: Libre (free), Pundar (to flourish/bloom), Pangunahin (primary/foremost), Natatangi (distinguished/exceptional)*

---

### Tier 1: LIBRE (Free)

**Price:** PHP 0 forever

**Target:** Solo/micro vendors (Segment A) and any vendor testing the platform

**Included:**
- Full vendor profile with business name, description, location, service areas, and category tags
- Photo gallery (up to 20 photos)
- 1 video embed (YouTube/Vimeo link)
- Contact form (couples can send inquiry; vendor gets email notification)
- Up to 3 package listings with pricing (encourages transparency)
- Display of up to 5 verified reviews from past clients
- "Verified Vendor" badge upon completing identity verification (DTI/SEC registration or valid ID)
- Basic monthly summary email: "You received X profile views and Y inquiries this month"
- Listing in standard search results (no priority placement)
- Mobile-responsive profile page (serves as vendor's de facto website)

**What is NOT included (and why it drives upgrades):**
- No priority search placement (appears after paid tiers in search results)
- No featured homepage or category page placement
- No inquiry analytics (conversion rates, inquiry sources, couple demographics)
- No portfolio pages (only basic gallery)
- No badge customization or promotional banners
- No direct messaging (inquiries go through contact form only)
- Limited to 1 service category listing

**Value Proposition for Vendors:**
"Your first professional wedding presence on the web -- for free. No booth fees. No Facebook spam. Real couples searching for vendors like you, finding you through proper search and filters. This is what Facebook groups should have been."

**Strategic Rationale:**
The free tier must be genuinely useful, not a teaser. A vendor on the Libre tier should get real inquiries. This builds trust in the platform, creates word-of-mouth among the vendor community, and ensures the marketplace has sufficient supply. The vendor sees real value, and the paid tiers offer *more* of that value, not the basic value behind a paywall.

---

### Tier 2: PUNDAR (Featured) -- PHP 1,499/month

**Price:**
- Monthly: PHP 1,499/month
- Annual: PHP 14,990/year (PHP 1,249/month effective -- save PHP 2,998/year)

**Target:** Established small businesses (Segment B) who want to stand out and get more qualified leads

**Everything in Libre, plus:**

**Visibility & Placement:**
- "Featured Vendor" badge on profile (gold accent)
- Priority placement in search results within your category and location (above Libre vendors)
- Eligible for homepage "Featured Vendors" rotation (rotating showcase of 8-12 vendors on the homepage)
- Eligible for category page "Top Picks" section

**Enhanced Profile:**
- Unlimited photo gallery (organized into albums: weddings, prenupts, events)
- Up to 5 video embeds
- Up to 10 package listings with detailed pricing breakdowns
- "About the Team" section with individual team member profiles
- Custom portfolio pages (up to 3 "Real Wedding" story pages with photos, descriptions, and vendor tags)
- Social media links displayed prominently
- Listing in up to 3 service categories (e.g., a photographer can also list under videography and prenupt photography)

**Lead Management:**
- Real-time inquiry notifications (push + email + SMS via integrated Philippine SMS gateway)
- Inquiry dashboard: see all inquiries in one place with status tracking (new, responded, booked, declined)
- Couple profile previews: see the couple's wedding date, location preference, estimated budget range, and guest count before responding
- Direct messaging with couples through the platform (threaded conversations)
- Response time badge: vendors who respond within 24 hours get a "Quick Responder" badge

**Analytics:**
- Monthly analytics dashboard:
  - Profile views (total and unique)
  - Search impressions (how often you appear in search results)
  - Inquiry count and conversion rate
  - Top-performing photos (which gallery images couples click most)
  - Traffic sources (direct search, category browse, homepage, external)
- Comparison to category average ("Your profile gets 2.3x more views than the average photographer in Metro Manila")

**Reviews & Trust:**
- Unlimited verified reviews
- Ability to respond publicly to reviews
- Review solicitation tool: send a post-wedding review request link to couples via email/SMS
- Review summary widget (average rating displayed prominently)

**Value Proposition for Vendors:**
"For less than the cost of one wedding fair lunch, get featured placement in front of couples who are actively searching for your exact service in your exact location. See who is inquiring, respond instantly, and track your ROI with real data -- not Facebook likes."

**Why PHP 1,499/month is the right price:**
- One wedding fair booth: PHP 15,000-50,000 for 2 days. Pundar costs PHP 14,990/year -- 365 days of visibility for the price of one cheap booth.
- Monthly Facebook ad budget for a small vendor: PHP 3,000-15,000. Pundar is cheaper and the leads are higher intent (couples searching on a wedding platform vs. scrolling their feed).
- A single booking from the platform (even a PHP 25,000 photography package) pays for 16+ months of Pundar.

---

### Tier 3: PANGUNAHIN (Premium) -- PHP 3,999/month

**Price:**
- Monthly: PHP 3,999/month
- Annual: PHP 39,990/year (PHP 3,332/month effective -- save PHP 7,998/year)

**Everything in Pundar, plus:**

**Maximum Visibility:**

**Lead Quality & Management:**

- Automated initial response templates (pre-written responses triggered by inquiry type)
- CRM integration readiness: export leads to common CRM tools (Google Sheets, HubSpot, or custom CSV)
- "Preferred Vendor" tagging: when a couple adds you to their shortlist, you are notified immediately

**Advanced Analytics:**
- Everything in Pundar analytics, plus:
  - Competitive benchmarking: see how your views, inquiries, and conversion rate compare to other vendors in your tier, category, and location (anonymized)
  - Inquiry quality trends: track budget ranges and wedding dates of inquiring couples over time
  - Seasonal demand forecasting: "Based on platform data, inquiry volume for Tagaytay venues peaks in November-February"
  - Content performance: which portfolio pages, blog posts, and photos drive the most inquiries

**Exclusive Benefits:**
- Priority customer support (dedicated account manager for onboarding and quarterly business reviews)
- Early access to new platform features
- Co-marketing opportunities: vendor spotlight articles on everaftr's blog and social media (1 feature per quarter)
- Invitation to everaftr's annual "Vendor Summit" (virtual or in-person networking event)

**Value Proposition for Vendors:**
"You're not just listed -- you're positioned as a market leader. Premium placement, qualified leads filtered to your standards, competitive intelligence, and the editorial support to build your brand. This is your digital showroom, your lead engine, and your competitive edge -- all in one subscription."

**Why PHP 3,999/month is the right price:**
- A single premium wedding booking (PHP 100,000-300,000 for a venue or premium photographer) pays for 2-6+ years of Pangunahin.
- Equivalent visibility through wedding fairs (4 events/year at PHP 25,000-50,000 each) costs PHP 100,000-200,000/year. Pangunahin costs PHP 39,990/year with 365-day visibility and measurable ROI.
- Facebook ads to reach the same quality of couple-in-market leads would cost PHP 20,000-50,000/month. Pangunahin delivers higher-intent traffic at a fraction of the cost.

---

### Tier 4: NATATANGI (Exclusive) -- PHP 9,999/month

**Price:**
- Monthly: PHP 9,999/month
- Annual: PHP 99,990/year (PHP 8,332/month effective -- save PHP 19,998/year)

**Target:** Celebrity/luxury vendors (Segment D) and top-tier venues -- limited to 3-5 vendors per category per major city

**Everything in Pangunahin, plus:**

**Exclusivity & Brand Positioning:**
- "Exclusive Partner" designation with a distinct visual treatment (think: full-width hero banner on their profile, not a standard card layout)
- Category exclusivity cap: only 3-5 Natatangi vendors per category per metro area, creating genuine scarcity
- Custom landing page on everaftr (e.g., everaftr.ph/partners/juan-carlo) with full editorial control
- "As Featured On everaftr" badge for use on their own website and marketing materials
- Joint PR: co-branded press releases and social media campaigns for major events (e.g., new collection launch, venue renovation reveal)

**Concierge Lead Management:**
- White-glove lead qualification: everaftr's team pre-screens inquiries before routing them to the vendor, ensuring only serious, budget-matched couples make contact
- Dedicated phone/WhatsApp line for lead management support
- Priority response commitment: vendor receives leads within 1 hour of couple inquiry during business hours
- Integration with vendor's existing booking system (calendar sync, no double-booking)

**Content & Marketing:**
- Quarterly editorial feature on everaftr's blog (professionally written vendor spotlight, "Real Wedding" story, or trend piece)
- Social media campaign inclusion: vendor featured in everaftr's Instagram, TikTok, and Facebook content (minimum 2 dedicated posts/quarter)
- Professional photography session: one annual brand shoot coordinated by everaftr (for vendors who want updated portfolio content)
- Access to everaftr's couple database for targeted email campaigns (anonymized, opt-in couples only; vendor provides the content, everaftr sends on their behalf)

**Strategic Intelligence:**
- Full competitive intelligence dashboard: market trends, pricing benchmarks, seasonal demand patterns
- Quarterly business review with everaftr's strategy team: discuss market positioning, lead pipeline, and growth opportunities
- First-look access to new couple signups matching vendor criteria (before other tiers see them)

**Value Proposition for Vendors:**
"This is not a listing. This is a strategic brand partnership. You are positioned as one of the top 3-5 vendors in your category in your city, with exclusivity, editorial support, and a concierge team managing your leads. For vendors who do not need more leads -- they need the *right* leads and the *right* brand placement."

**Why PHP 9,999/month is the right price:**
- This tier targets vendors with annual revenues of PHP 20M+. The annual cost (PHP 99,990) is approximately 0.5% of their revenue.
- The exclusivity cap creates genuine value: being one of only 3-5 vendors in your category on the platform that is becoming the default for Filipino couples is worth far more than the subscription price.
- The concierge lead qualification alone saves these vendors 10-20 hours/month of screening unqualified inquiries.
- A single luxury wedding booking (PHP 500,000+) pays for 4+ years of Natatangi.

## 5. Cold-Start Strategy

### 5.1 The Chicken-and-Egg Problem

everaftr needs vendors to attract couples and couples to attract vendors. With 80 vendors already on the platform, the vendor side has a foundation. The challenge is: **how do you generate enough couple traffic to demonstrate value to vendors before you have a large couple base?**

### 5.2 Supply-Side (Vendors): Already Ahead

**Current position:** 80 vendors across 8 categories and 9 locations. This is enough to be useful to couples.

**Phase 1 strategy (Months 1-3): Grow to 200 vendors on Libre tier**

Tactics:
1. **Vendor referral program:** Each vendor who refers another verified vendor gets 1 month of Pundar free. This leverages the tight-knit Filipino wedding vendor community.
2. **Wedding fair guerrilla marketing:** Attend 2-3 major wedding fairs (Wedding Library, Themes & Motifs) -- not as a booth vendor, but as a service. Offer free profile creation on the spot with a tablet and photographer. "Your everaftr profile is live in 10 minutes."
3. **Provincial outreach:** Vendors in Davao, Iloilo, Pampanga have near-zero digital discoverability. Reach out directly via Facebook (ironically, where they are). Pitch: "You're invisible to couples searching online. We fix that for free."
4. **Content-as-acquisition:** Publish "Top 10 [Category] Vendors in [City]" articles on everaftr's blog. Vendors featured will naturally share these articles, driving their own audiences to the platform.
5. **Facebook group infiltration (ethical):** Become a helpful presence in major wedding Facebook groups (e.g., "Wedding Planning Philippines," "Budget Wedding PH"). When couples ask for vendor recommendations, link to relevant everaftr category pages (not individual vendors).

### 5.3 Demand-Side (Couples): The Real Challenge

**Phase 1 strategy (Months 1-6): Reach 5,000 registered couples**

Tactics:
1. **SEO-first content strategy:** Build the best wedding planning content hub in the Philippines. Target long-tail keywords: "Tagaytay wedding venue prices 2026," "how much does a wedding photographer cost Philippines," "Cebu wedding caterer reviews." These searches have buying intent and zero competition from current platforms.
2. **Instagram & TikTok content:** Real wedding features, vendor spotlights, "How much does a Filipino wedding cost?" breakdowns. Tag featured vendors (they reshare to their audiences).
3. **Google Business optimization for vendors:** Help vendors optimize their Google Business profiles with a link back to their everaftr profile. This creates a traffic pipeline.
4. **Wedding document/checklist lead magnet:** Create the most comprehensive Filipino wedding planning checklist (including the specific Philippine document requirements -- CENOMAR, marriage license, PSA). Gate it behind email registration. These couples are in active planning mode.
5. **Strategic partnerships:**
   - Partner with BDO, Metrobank, or BPI wedding loan products (they need to reach engaged couples too)
   - Partner with Lazada/Shopee wedding category (cross-promotion)
   - Partner with wedding dress rental shops and bridal boutiques for in-store QR code displays
6. **LGBTQ+ community outreach:** Partner with LGBTQ+ organizations (Metro Manila Pride, Bahaghari, Love Is All We Need PH). The inclusive positioning is a genuine differentiator and generates press coverage.

### 5.4 The Flywheel: Proving Value to Convert Free Vendors to Paid

The critical conversion path: **Libre vendor gets 3-5 inquiries in their first month --> sees value --> wants more --> upgrades to Pundar.**

To accelerate this flywheel in the early months:
- **Seed the platform with couple demand manually.** Reach out to recently engaged couples (wedding announcement Facebook groups, Instagram engagement hashtags like #SaidYesPH, #IsaidYes) and personally invite them to browse vendors on everaftr.
- **Vendor success stories as social proof.** The moment a Libre vendor gets a booking through the platform, document it. "Maria, a solo photographer in Davao, got her first PHP 35,000 booking through everaftr in 2 weeks." This story converts other vendors more than any feature list.
- **Artificial scarcity on paid tiers (early period).** "Only 20 Pundar spots available in Metro Manila for launch. First 20 vendors who upgrade get 3 months at 50% off." This creates urgency while limiting the revenue risk.

## 6. Vendor Metrics & Dashboard

### 6.1 What Vendors Actually Care About

Based on vendor research and the pain points identified, vendors care about these metrics in this priority order:

| Priority | Metric | Why It Matters | How everaftr Delivers |
|----------|--------|----------------|----------------------|
| 1 | **Number of qualified inquiries** | This is the only metric that directly translates to revenue | Inquiry count displayed prominently; trend over time; comparison to category average |
| 2 | **Inquiry-to-booking conversion rate** | Tells them if the platform is sending the RIGHT couples | Vendors mark inquiries as "booked" or "not booked"; system calculates conversion rate |
| 3 | **Profile views** | Leading indicator of inquiry volume; validates that the platform has traffic | Daily/weekly/monthly view counts; geographic breakdown of viewers |
| 4 | **Search impressions** | How often they appear in search results | Shows keyword/category impressions; helpful for understanding discoverability |
| 5 | **Average response time** | Correlated with booking rate; motivates faster responses | Tracks time between inquiry receipt and first vendor response |
| 6 | **Review score and count** | Social proof that drives more inquiries | Aggregate rating; review velocity; comparison to category average |
| 7 | **Competitive position** | Where they stand relative to peers | Category ranking; view/inquiry benchmarks (Pangunahin+ only) |

### 6.2 Dashboard Design Principles

- **Mobile-first:** Most Filipino vendors manage their business from their phone. The dashboard must work flawlessly on mobile.
- **Weekly email digest:** Not all vendors will log in regularly. Send a weekly email: "This week: X views, Y inquiries, Z are waiting for your response."
- **Actionable, not overwhelming:** Show 3-4 key numbers prominently. Details available on tap/click.
- **Filipino language option:** Dashboard and notifications should be available in Filipino (Tagalog) for vendors outside Metro Manila.
- **SMS notifications for inquiries:** In the Philippines, SMS is still heavily used for business communications. Inquiry alerts via SMS (Globe/Smart integration) are critical.

### 6.3 Metrics That Drive Upgrades

The dashboard should strategically show what paid tiers unlock:

- **Libre tier dashboard shows:** "You appeared in 47 searches this month. Pundar vendors in your category appeared in 120+ searches. [Upgrade to Pundar]"
- **Pundar tier dashboard shows:** "Your inquiry conversion rate is 12%. Pangunahin vendors using lead filtering average 22%. [Upgrade to Pangunahin]"

This is not manipulative -- it is showing vendors genuine data about what higher tiers deliver. The vendor decides if the delta is worth the cost.

## 7. Preventing the Zillow Problem

### 7.1 What the Zillow Problem Is

On Zillow's Premier Agent program, real estate agents pay for leads but complain that:
- Leads are shared among multiple agents (no exclusivity)
- Leads are low quality (tire-kickers, wrong price range, wrong location)
- There is no way to filter which leads you receive
- The platform profits regardless of whether the agent closes a deal

Applied to everaftr: **if vendors pay for visibility but receive inquiries from couples who cannot afford them, are in the wrong location, or are not serious, vendors will churn.**

### 7.2 How everaftr Prevents This

**Strategy 1: Couple qualification at inquiry time**

When a couple sends an inquiry, they must provide:
- Wedding date (or approximate month/year)
- Location preference
- Estimated budget range (dropdown, not free text -- ranges like "PHP 20,000-50,000," "PHP 50,000-100,000," etc.)
- Guest count (for venues/caterers)
- Brief description of what they are looking for

This is not optional. A vendor who receives an inquiry sees this context upfront, eliminating "cold" messages with no detail.

**Strategy 2: Budget range matching (Pangunahin+ tiers)**

Vendors on Pangunahin and above can set their minimum budget. Couples whose stated budget is below the vendor's minimum see a gentle message: "This vendor's services typically start at PHP [X]. Would you still like to inquire?" This reduces mismatched inquiries by an estimated 40-60%.

**Strategy 3: No lead sharing for subscriptions**

Unlike Zillow's model where multiple agents receive the same lead, everaftr's subscription model gives vendors visibility -- not shared leads. When a couple inquires with a specific vendor, that inquiry goes ONLY to that vendor. The couple chose them. This is fundamentally different from a lead distribution model.

**Strategy 4: Quality signals for vendors**

Before responding, vendors see:
- Is this the couple's first inquiry on the platform, or have they inquired with 15 vendors? (A couple who has inquired with 2-3 vendors is more serious than one who blasted 20.)
- Has the couple verified their email?
- How complete is the couple's profile?

**Strategy 5: Feedback loop**

After each inquiry, vendors can mark the outcome (booked, not booked -- and if not booked, why: budget mismatch, date conflict, chose another vendor, no response from couple). This data feeds back into the platform's matching algorithm over time and helps everaftr identify and address systematic quality issues.

**Strategy 6: No pay-per-lead as the primary model (by design)**

The subscription model means vendors pay for *visibility and tools*, not for individual leads. This aligns incentives: everaftr succeeds when vendors succeed, not when everaftr generates more (possibly low-quality) leads. The optional Lead Pack add-on exists for vendors who want it, but the core model is subscription-based.

## 8. Premium vs. Small Vendor Treatment

### 8.1 The Tension

Premium vendors (Jason Magbanua, Francis Libiran, Juan Carlo) and small vendors (solo photographer in Iloilo, freelance makeup artist in Pampanga) have fundamentally different needs. If the platform caters only to premium vendors, small vendors feel excluded and the marketplace lacks breadth. If it caters only to small vendors, premium vendors see it as a budget directory and refuse to associate their brand with it.

### 8.2 The Solution: Parallel Tracks, Unified Platform

**For couples (the demand side):**
- All vendors appear in the same search results, but with clear visual signals of tier and price range
- Couples can filter by budget range, which naturally segments premium from budget vendors
- Premium vendors have richer profiles (custom landing pages, virtual tours, editorial content) that signal their positioning without requiring a separate "luxury" section
- An optional "Curated Collection" section on the homepage features 5-10 handpicked vendors across tiers, ensuring both a Jason Magbanua AND a talented emerging photographer in Davao can be highlighted

**For small vendors (Segment A):**
- The Libre tier is genuinely functional, not a glorified placeholder
- The Verified Vendor badge is available for FREE -- this is important because it gives small vendors a credibility signal they currently cannot get on Facebook
- Small vendor success stories are prominently featured (Instagram, blog, newsletter) -- this is not a "premium vendors only" platform
- Provincial vendors get special SEO treatment: everaftr should dominate long-tail searches like "wedding photographer Iloilo" and "caterer Davao," which premium Metro Manila vendors do not target
- "Rising Star" badge for new vendors who achieve high inquiry response rates and review scores in their first 90 days

**For premium vendors (Segment C-D):**
- The Pangunahin and Natatangi tiers provide the exclusivity signals they need
- Lead filtering ensures they do not receive PHP 20,000-budget inquiries when their minimum is PHP 200,000
- Custom landing pages (Natatangi) look and feel distinct from standard profiles -- these vendors get editorial control
- Category exclusivity cap (Natatangi: 3-5 per category per city) ensures they are not one of 50 "premium" vendors
- No forced price transparency: premium vendors can choose to display "Starting at PHP ___" or "Contact for pricing" -- they should not be forced to reveal full pricing if that is not their business model
- everaftr's editorial team writes about them (quarterly features) -- this is content marketing FOR the vendor, not just a listing

### 8.3 Preventing Platform Bifurcation

The risk is that premium vendors demand a separate "luxury" platform. To prevent this:
- **Design quality matters:** The entire platform must feel premium. Clean design, fast load times, high-quality imagery. A Jason Magbanua profile should look as good as his own website.
- **Curation over quantity:** Resist the temptation to list every possible vendor. Maintain a verification standard. A platform with 200 verified vendors is more valuable to premium vendors than one with 2,000 unvetted listings.
- **Inclusive does not mean cheap:** The "inclusive" positioning (LGBTQ+ welcome) actually helps with premium vendors -- progressive luxury couples are a growing segment, and premium vendors want access to them.

- Or approximately: 500+ total vendors with 20% paid conversion
- **Estimated timeline:** Month 15-20 (moderate scenario)

## Appendix A: Competitive Pricing Comparison

| Platform | Market | Free Tier | Paid Starting Price | Top Tier |
|----------|--------|-----------|-------------------|----------|
| **The Knot/WeddingWire** (US) | United States | Free storefront (new in 2024) | ~USD 125-150/mo (PHP 7,000-8,400) | USD 500-1,200/mo (PHP 28,000-67,200) |
| **Bridestory** (SEA) | Indonesia/SEA | Free basic listing | IDR 10,000/mo (~PHP 35) to millions IDR | Custom enterprise pricing |
| **Bride and Breakfast** (PH) | Philippines | Free directory listing | Estimated PHP 5,000-20,000 per feature | N/A (content model, not SaaS) |
| **EventNest.ph** (PH) | Philippines | Free listing | Unknown/not publicly listed | Unknown |
| **everaftr** (PH) | Philippines | **Full-featured free tier** | **PHP 1,499/mo** | **PHP 9,999/mo** |

everaftr's pricing is:
- **80-85% cheaper than The Knot/WeddingWire** (appropriate for PH market purchasing power)
- **More feature-rich than Bridestory** at comparable price points
- **Structured as SaaS** (unlike B&B's one-off content model), providing predictable recurring revenue

## Appendix B: Pricing Sensitivity Analysis

### "What if PHP 1,499/month is too high for small vendors?"

**Mitigation strategies:**
1. **Quarterly payment option:** PHP 3,999/quarter (PHP 1,333/month effective) -- lower perceived commitment
2. **Success-based pricing for early adopters:** "Pay PHP 999/month for the first 6 months. If you get fewer than 3 inquiries/month, we'll refund the difference."
3. **Bartering credits:** For certain vendors (especially photographers), offer free Pundar access in exchange for providing photos of their work that everaftr can use in marketing materials (with proper attribution)
4. **Referral discounts:** Permanent PHP 200/month discount for each vendor they refer who also subscribes

### "What if premium vendors don't see value?"

**Mitigation strategies:**
1. **Pilot period:** Offer 1 month free Pangunahin to top 10 vendors. If they get quality inquiries, they convert. If not, the platform is not ready for their tier and that is useful signal.
2. **Exclusivity sell:** "Only 5 spots in Metro Manila Photography. Your competitors are already on the platform." FOMO is real in tight vendor communities.
3. **Data-led pitch:** After 3 months of Libre, show the vendor their profile data. "You received 47 profile views and 12 inquiries on our free tier. On Pangunahin, vendors in your category average 3x that."

## Appendix C: Risk Factors and Mitigations

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Vendors don't see enough inquiries to justify paying | High (early stage) | Critical | Delay monetization until couple base is sufficient; "money-back" guarantee in early months |
| A well-funded competitor enters (e.g., The Knot enters PH) | Low-Medium | High | Move fast; build vendor relationships and couple habits before competitors arrive; local knowledge is a moat |
| Premium vendors refuse to participate | Medium | Medium | Does not block revenue model -- Pundar tier is the volume play; premium vendors can be added later |
| Vendor churn exceeds 10%/month | Medium | High | Improve lead quality; add vendor success team; offer annual plan incentives; feature roadmap informed by churn reasons |
| Facebook launches a wedding vendor marketplace feature | Low | Very High | Facebook's track record on vertical marketplaces is poor (see: Facebook Jobs, Facebook Local); curation and trust are hard to replicate in a general platform |
| Economic downturn reduces wedding spending | Medium | Medium | Wedding spending is culturally resilient in the Philippines; budget-conscious couples need a platform even more (to compare prices and find deals) |
