## 1. Executive Summary

The wedding RSVP website and guest photo sharing markets are dominated by US-centric platforms (Joy, Zola, The Knot, Minted) that offer free or low-cost RSVP websites but completely ignore the Filipino wedding context. Meanwhile, guest photo sharing apps (GuestCam, GUESTPIX, Wedibox, WedShoots) operate as standalone tools disconnected from RSVP and wedding planning.

**The massive gap:** No platform combines RSVP website building + guest photo sharing + Filipino cultural features (ninong/ninang management, GCash/Maya integration, Tagalog/Cebuano language support, ceremony-type awareness) into one seamless, mobile-first experience.

haraya has the opportunity to own this intersection.

## 6. UX Pain Points & Complaints

### 6.1 RSVP-Specific Problems

Based on user complaints across platforms:

1. **"Guest not found" errors** - The Knot's RSVP system frequently fails to find guests even when names are spelled correctly. This is the #1 complaint.

2. **Redirect confusion** - Some platforms redirect RSVP attempts to a "create your own wedding website" page instead of the actual RSVP form.

3. **Household RSVP friction** - When family members can't RSVP together, someone has to type each name, meal choice, and guest separately, leading to confusion about "which meal is for who."

4. **No clear confirmation** - Guests are unsure if their RSVP was received. No confirmation email or visual feedback.

5. **Multiple RSVP complexity** - Multi-event weddings (ceremony, reception, after-party) create confusing multi-step RSVP flows.

6. **Older guests struggle** - Password-protected sites and multi-step forms confuse less tech-savvy guests (particularly relevant for Filipino titas and titos, and lolo/lola).

7. **Ad interference** - The Knot's ad-supported model means vendor ads appear on the couple's personal wedding page.

### 6.2 Photo Sharing Problems

1. **App download friction** - Any platform requiring an app download sees significantly lower participation. This is the #1 barrier.

2. **Upload timing** - Guests forget to upload photos after the event; short upload windows (7-30 days) miss late uploads.

3. **Quality concerns** - Some platforms compress images, losing quality.

4. **No curation** - All photos dumped in one gallery with no organization or filtering (blurry, duplicate, unflattering photos mixed with great ones).

5. **Cost surprise** - Couples expect free but hit paywalls for downloading their own photos in full resolution.

6. **Privacy concerns** - Guests uncomfortable with face recognition or sharing photos publicly.

### 6.3 Filipino-Specific Pain Points

1. **No Tagalog/Bisaya option** - Every platform is English-only.

2. **No GCash integration** - Cash gifts are the norm in Filipino weddings; no platform supports GCash/Maya/QR Ph for digital monetary gifts ("digital ampao/angpao").

3. **Ninong/Ninang management** - No platform has a concept of "principal sponsors" who need to RSVP differently (they legally sign the marriage certificate and cannot send proxies).

4. **Ceremony-type unawareness** - Catholic Pre-Cana, Muslim Nikah, Civil ceremonies all have different requirements that no platform addresses.

5. **Guest count mismatch** - Filipino weddings often have 200-500+ guests; free tiers that cap at 80-100 are inadequate.

6. **Slow networks** - Budget Android phones on 4G need lightweight, fast-loading pages. Heavy JS frameworks fail.

7. **No ride-hailing integration** - No one-tap Grab/JoyRide links for venue navigation.

---

## 7. Filipino-Specific Gaps

### 7.1 Cultural Features No Platform Offers

| Feature | Why It Matters | Current Status |
|---------|---------------|----------------|
| **Ninong/Ninang tracker** | Principal sponsors are legally required; must confirm attendance (no proxies) | Not offered anywhere |
| **Ceremony-type RSVP logic** | Catholic weddings need different info than Muslim Nikah or Civil ceremonies | Not offered anywhere |
| **Entourage management** | Secondary sponsors for candle, cord, veil, coins (arrhae) ceremonies | Not offered anywhere |
| **GCash/Maya gift integration** | Cash gifts are the norm; digital payment is needed for modern/overseas guests | Not offered anywhere |
| **Tagalog/Bisaya language toggle** | Many older guests prefer Filipino | Only Love, D. Concepts offers Tagalog templates |
| **Filipino naming conventions** | Support for "Ma.", "Jr.", "III", nicknames in parentheses | Not handled properly anywhere |
| **Grab/JoyRide venue links** | Guests need one-tap navigation to venues | Not offered anywhere |
| **Smart/Globe SMS reminders** | SMS is more reliable than email for many Filipino guests | EventNest mentions this but no self-service platform offers it |
| **Data Privacy Act compliance** | RA 10173 requires specific consent language | Not addressed by international platforms |
| **Lechon count / catering head count** | Filipino receptions plan food per-head with specific Filipino dishes | Generic meal preference forms don't capture this |

### 7.2 The "Digital Angpao" Opportunity

Filipino wedding gifts are predominantly cash, traditionally placed in envelopes ("ampao" or "angpao") at the reception. With GCash processing over 4 billion transactions and 94 million registered users, there's a massive opportunity to:

1. Generate a wedding-specific GCash/Maya QR code
2. Let guests send monetary gifts digitally before, during, or after the event
3. Track cash gifts alongside physical envelopes
4. Support overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) sending gifts via QR Ph or bank transfer
5. Provide multi-currency support with automatic PHP settlement

**No platform does this.** This is a blue ocean feature.

---

## 8. Competitive Opportunities for haraya

### 8.1 Strategic Positioning

haraya should position as: **"The only wedding platform built for Filipino celebrations"**

The competitive landscape reveals a clear three-layer opportunity:

```
LAYER 1: RSVP Website (compete with Joy, Zola, The Knot)
  + Filipino language, ceremony-type awareness, ninong/ninang management
  + GCash/Maya digital gifts
  + Mobile-first for budget Android phones

LAYER 2: Guest Photo Sharing (compete with GuestCam, GUESTPIX, WedShoots)
  + QR code guest photo upload (no app download)
  + Live slideshow at reception
  + AI face recognition (selfie to find your photos)
  + Integrated into the RSVP website (not a separate tool)

LAYER 3: Filipino Cultural Layer (compete with nobody)
  + Ninong/Ninang tracker with legal requirements
  + Ceremony-type specific checklists and RSVP logic
  + Entourage management (candle, cord, veil, coins sponsors)
  + Digital angpao via GCash/Maya/QR Ph
  + Tagalog/Bisaya/English language toggle
  + Grab/JoyRide venue navigation
  + Smart/Globe SMS reminders
```

### 8.2 What Makes haraya's RSVP Experience the Best

| haraya Feature | Joy (Best Competitor) | Why haraya Wins |
|----------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| Ceremony-type aware RSVP | Generic RSVP | Catholic, Muslim, Civil, INC ceremonies each get relevant questions |
| Ninong/Ninang RSVP | Same as regular guest | Special sponsor RSVP flow with legal attendance confirmation |
| GCash/Maya gift QR | No cash gift support | One-tap digital angpao; tracks gifts alongside physical envelopes |
| Tagalog toggle | English only | Lola can RSVP in Filipino |
| Budget Android first | Mobile responsive | Optimized for sub-$100 Android phones on 4G |
| Grab venue link | Generic address | One-tap to Grab/JoyRide with exact pickup/dropoff |
| Integrated photo album | Requires Joy app | QR scan in browser, no app download, instant upload |
| Live reception slideshow | Available | Same, but culturally themed (Woven Heritage design) |
| Digital guestbook | Basic | Audio/video messages with Filipino prompts |
| SMS reminders | Email only | Smart/Globe/Dito SMS for reliable Filipino delivery |

### 8.3 What Makes haraya's Guest Photo Feature the Best

The "guest as photographer" concept should be integrated directly into the RSVP website (not a separate app). Here's how to beat every competitor:

1. **Zero friction:** QR code scan opens mobile browser. No app download. No login. No account creation.
2. **Instant upload:** Tap to take photo or select from gallery. Automatic upload with progress indicator.
3. **Smart organization:** AI auto-tags photos by time, location within venue, and (opt-in) face recognition.
4. **Live slideshow:** Photos appear on venue TV/projector within seconds. Couple can moderate (approve before display or auto-display).
5. **Cultural touches:** Photo frames/filters inspired by Filipino textiles (Woven Heritage design system). "SDE" (Same Day Edit) integration for videographer uploads.
6. **Post-wedding value:** Full gallery available for download for 12+ months. AI-curated "best of" album. Print-ready exports.
7. **Social integration:** Share to Facebook/Instagram stories with haraya watermark. Tag @haraya.ph for brand visibility.

### 8.4 Pricing Strategy

Based on competitive analysis:

| Tier | Price | Target | Features |
|------|-------|--------|----------|
| **Free** | PHP 0 | All couples | RSVP website, up to 150 guests, basic photo sharing (50 photos), 3 months access |
| **Kasalan** | PHP 999 (~$18) | Standard weddings | Unlimited guests, unlimited photos, live slideshow, 12-month access, custom domain, GCash integration |
| **Pista** | PHP 2,499 (~$45) | Premium celebrations | Everything in Kasalan + AI face recognition, SMS reminders, SDE video integration, priority support, printed QR cards shipped to couple |

**Why this pricing works:**
- Free tier serves 150 guests (adequate for smaller Filipino weddings, beats RSVPify's 100 and Say I Do's 80)
- PHP 999 is less than the cost of a single lechon and FAR cheaper than printed invitations
- PHP 2,499 is still 70-80% cheaper than US platforms' premium tiers in absolute terms
- GCash/Maya integration in the paid tier creates a monetization flywheel (couples pay to collect gifts digitally)
