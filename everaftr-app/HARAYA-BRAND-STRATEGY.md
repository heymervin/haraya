## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### What Is haraya?

haraya is the Philippines' first inclusive, culturally rooted celebration planning platform. The name comes from the Filipino/Tagalog word meaning "imagination," "creative vision," and "dream" -- a word that captures the emotional heart of what every couple does when they begin planning their future together. They dream. They imagine. They envision. haraya is where those dreams take shape.

The platform combines a vendor directory, planning tools, an AI assistant named Kasa, a matchmaker quiz, community features, real celebration stories, and couple websites -- all designed mobile-first for Filipino couples aged 25-35, inclusive of every ceremony type, every love story, and every budget.

### Why We Rebranded

The project began as "everaftr" with a Woven Heritage design system rooted in six Filipino textile traditions. While the cultural research was valuable, the brand had accumulated complexity: a textile-to-section color mapping that users would never perceive, a dropped-E naming convention that created friction in functional UI, and a visual language (warm ivories, heritage reds, woven borders) that, while culturally rich, felt more archival than aspirational. The platform needed a name and identity that Filipino couples would feel in their bones, not one they needed explained.

"haraya" achieves this. It is a single Filipino word that every Tagalog speaker recognizes. It is beautiful in speech and in writing. It immediately communicates what the platform is about -- dreams, imagination, creative vision -- without requiring a cultural footnote. The visual identity shifts from textile heritage to an ethereal, dreamy aesthetic built on Dream Lavender and Twilight Blue, which feels modern, inclusive, and unmistakably aspirational.

This is not a pivot. It is an evolution. The core strategic foundations remain: Filipino cultural intelligence as the deepest moat, inclusivity built into the architecture, vendor trust through ethical practices, and a mobile-first experience designed for the realities of the Philippine market. What changes is the name, the visual identity, the emotional register, and the brand personality. Everything gets lighter, dreamier, and more inviting.

### What This Means

- **For the product:** The codebase transitions from the everaftr/Woven Heritage design system to the haraya design system. All color tokens, typography, component styles, and brand copy must be updated.
- **For the team:** All internal documents, social handles, domain registrations, and communications reference "haraya" going forward.
- **For vendors:** Any vendor outreach, partnership materials, and listing pages carry the haraya brand.
- **For couples:** They will meet a platform that feels like a dream they are stepping into, not a heritage museum they are visiting.

## 2. BRAND IDENTITY

### 2.1 Brand Name

**haraya**

- Always written in lowercase: `haraya`
- Never capitalized: not "Haraya", "HARAYA", or "HaRaYa"
- One word, no spaces, no hyphens, no abbreviations
- Pronounced: hah-RAH-yah (three syllables, stress on the second)
- Origin: Filipino/Tagalog -- meaning imagination, creative vision, dream, the power of the mind to envision what does not yet exist

The name was chosen because:
1. It is a real Filipino word that Tagalog speakers recognize immediately
2. It captures the emotional truth of celebration planning: every couple starts by dreaming
3. It is beautiful in both speech and writing
4. It works in English and Filipino contexts without translation
5. It is distinctive, memorable, and available as a brand

### 2.2 Tagline

**Primary tagline:** "where dreams take shape"

This tagline works on two levels. Literally, haraya (the platform) is the place where the dreams of a celebration take tangible form through vendor discovery, planning tools, and community support. Metaphorically, it speaks to the universal human experience of turning an imagined future into a lived reality.

**Secondary taglines (use as appropriate):**
- "imagine your celebration" -- for onboarding, quiz entry points, aspirational moments
- "every dream, every celebration" -- for inclusive messaging, homepage hero alternatives
- "dream it. plan it. celebrate it." -- for action-oriented contexts, feature marketing
- "your celebration, beautifully imagined" -- for premium/aspirational contexts

**Retired taglines (do not use):**
- "plan together, celebrate forevr" (everaftr)
- "where forevr begins" (everaftr)
- "six threads. one platform. every couple." (everaftr/Woven Heritage)
- "for every couple. every love story. every celebration." (everaftr)

### 2.3 Brand Promise

haraya promises Filipino couples a celebration planning experience that honors their dreams, respects their identity, and makes the journey from imagination to reality feel beautiful rather than overwhelming.

### 2.4 Brand Personality

haraya's personality is defined by five adjectives:

1. **Dreamy** -- The brand lives in the space between imagination and reality. Everything about haraya feels aspirational and ethereal, like the best version of a couple's vision made tangible. This is not fantasy; it is grounded dreaming.

2. **Warm** -- haraya is never cold, clinical, or transactional. The platform speaks to couples like a trusted friend who genuinely cares about their celebration. The warmth comes from knowing Filipino culture, respecting every relationship, and celebrating the emotional weight of what couples are building.

3. **Inclusive** -- haraya sees every love story. Catholic, civil, Muslim, LGBTQ+, intercultural, destination, intimate, grand -- all celebrations are welcomed by default, not as a feature to be toggled on. Inclusivity is the architecture, not the marketing.

4. **Modern** -- haraya feels current, clean, and technologically confident. The design is contemporary without being cold. The tools are smart without being intimidating. The experience is what Filipino couples expect from a platform built in 2026, not 2001.

5. **Filipino** -- haraya is rooted in the Philippines. Not as a heritage exhibit, but as a living, breathing understanding of how Filipino couples actually plan celebrations. The platform knows about ninongs, Pre-Cana, CENOMAR, same-day edit videos, and the tita politics of guest list management. This cultural intelligence is woven into every feature and every piece of content.

### 2.5 Brand Voice Guidelines

haraya speaks with a consistent voice across all touchpoints: the product UI, social media, email communications, vendor outreach, and customer support.

**Tone:** Gentle, encouraging, and knowledgeable. haraya is the friend who has already planned a celebration and is now quietly, warmly helping you plan yours. Never pushy. Never salesy. Never condescending.

**Register:** Conversational but polished. haraya uses complete sentences but avoids corporate stiffness. The language is accessible to the 25-35 Filipino demographic without being overly casual or using excessive slang.

**Vocabulary Principles:**

| Principle | What This Means | Example |
|-----------|----------------|---------|
| Dream language | Use words that evoke imagination, vision, aspiration | "Imagine your perfect venue" not "Search for venues" |
| Warm personalization | Address the couple directly, use "you" and "your" | "Your celebration is taking shape" not "The celebration plan has been updated" |
| Filipino naturalness | Use Filipino terms where they feel natural, not forced | "Confirm your ninong/ninang list" not "Confirm your sponsors list" |
| Gentle encouragement | Celebrate progress, never pressure | "Beautiful progress -- you have completed 12 tasks" not "You still have 32 tasks remaining!" |
| Inclusive defaults | Never assume gender, ceremony type, or relationship structure | "You and your partner" not "bride and groom" |

**Voice Examples:**

| Context | Do Write | Do Not Write |
|---------|----------|--------------|
| Homepage hero | "Where dreams take shape. Plan your celebration with tools built for Filipino couples." | "Find the best wedding suppliers! Book now!" |
| Empty state (no vendors saved) | "Your favorites list is waiting. Browse vendors and save the ones that spark something." | "No favorites yet. Add vendors to your list." |
| Checklist completion | "Another step closer to your dream celebration." | "Task completed." |
| Quiz invitation | "What does your dream celebration look like? Let's find out together." | "Take our quiz to get matched with vendors!" |
| Error state | "Something went wrong on our end. We are working on it -- your planning data is safe." | "Error 500. Please try again later." |
| Vendor outreach | "We built haraya because Filipino couples deserve better planning tools. We would love to feature your work." | "List your business on our platform for free leads!" |

**Code-Switching (Taglish):** In social media content (Instagram, TikTok, Facebook), haraya uses natural Filipino-English code-switching that mirrors how the target audience actually speaks. In product UI and formal communications, English is the primary language with Filipino terms used where culturally appropriate (ninong/ninang, Pre-Cana, CENOMAR, etc.).

### 2.6 Core Values

1. **Every dream is valid.** A PHP 50,000 intimate civil ceremony is celebrated with the same respect as a PHP 3,000,000 grand cathedral wedding. haraya never creates hierarchies of celebration.

2. **Every love story belongs.** Inclusivity is not a feature -- it is the foundation. The platform is built from the database schema up to welcome every couple, every ceremony type, and every relationship.

3. **Filipino couples deserve world-class tools.** The Philippines has no dominant digital wedding platform. haraya exists to close that gap with a product that stands alongside the best planning platforms globally while being deeply rooted in Filipino reality.

4. **Vendors are partners, not products.** haraya will never use pay-to-play ranking, long-term contracts, or mass-inquiry spam. Vendors are treated as collaborators whose success is our success.

5. **Dreams need structure.** Imagination without tools is just wishing. haraya gives dreams a backbone: checklists, budgets, timelines, and vendor connections that turn vision into reality.

---

## 3. VISUAL IDENTITY SUMMARY

### 3.1 Design Philosophy

The haraya visual identity is built on the concept of **ethereal dreaming made tangible**. Where the previous Woven Heritage system drew from textile traditions and earthy, warm tones, the haraya system draws from the liminal space between sleep and waking -- the moment when a dream is vivid enough to feel real. The palette is soft, luminous, and slightly otherworldly. The typography balances elegance with readability. The signature elements (flowing infinity mark, dream gradients, shimmer effects) create a visual language that feels like stepping into a beautiful dream.

**Design Principles:**
- **Light over heavy.** Backgrounds are cloud-white and pearl, not ivory and cream. The overall impression is bright and airy.
- **Soft over sharp.** Borders are gentle, corners are rounded, shadows are diffused. Nothing feels harsh or angular.
- **Luminous over flat.** Subtle gradients, shimmer effects, and layered transparency create depth without heaviness.
- **Spacious over dense.** Generous whitespace lets the content breathe. The platform never feels cramped.
- **Dreamy over decorative.** Visual interest comes from color, light, and space -- not from patterns, textures, or ornamental elements.

### 3.2 Color System

#### Primary Palette

| Name | Hex | RGB | Role |
|------|-----|-----|------|
| **Dream Lavender** | `#9D8BD8` | 157, 139, 216 | Primary brand color. CTAs, active states, brand accents, links. The heart of the haraya identity. |
| **Twilight Blue** | `#5B7C99` | 91, 124, 153 | Secondary brand color. Supporting accents, information states, depth. Grounds the dreaminess with trust and calm. |

#### Accent Palette

| Name | Hex | RGB | Role |
|------|-----|-----|------|
| **Sunset Blush** | `#F4B8C5` | 244, 184, 197 | Warm accent. Notifications, gentle highlights, love/heart elements. Adds warmth without gendering. |
| **Golden Hour** | `#F4C688` | 244, 198, 136 | Premium accent. Featured badges, ratings, celebration moments, success highlights. |
| **Morning Mist** | `#C5D5E4` | 197, 213, 228 | Cool accent. Borders, dividers, subtle backgrounds, disabled states. The quiet color. |

#### Canvas Colors (Backgrounds)

| Name | Hex | RGB | Role |
|------|-----|-----|------|
| **Cloud White** | `#F7F5FB` | 247, 245, 251 | Primary app background. Has a barely perceptible lavender warmth. |
| **Pearl** | `#FDFCFE` | 253, 252, 254 | Card backgrounds, elevated surfaces. Almost white but not cold. |
| **Whisper** | `#EEEEF5` | 238, 238, 245 | Secondary surfaces, input backgrounds, section dividers. |

#### Text Colors

| Name | Hex | RGB | Role |
|------|-----|-----|------|
| **Midnight** | `#2A2838` | 42, 40, 56 | Primary text. Headings, body text, critical UI labels. Deep enough for contrast, warm enough to avoid harshness. |
| **Dusk Gray** | `#6B6B7D` | 107, 107, 125 | Secondary text. Captions, meta information, helper text, placeholders. Passes WCAG AA on Cloud White. |

#### Semantic Colors

| Name | Hex | Role |
|------|-----|------|
| **Success** | `#4A9D7E` | Completed items, confirmations, positive states |
| **Warning** | `#D4A843` | Pending items, caution states, approaching deadlines |
| **Error** | `#D45B5B` | Error messages, destructive actions, alerts |
| **Info** | `#5B7C99` (Twilight Blue) | Informational messages, tips, guidance |

#### Color Usage Rules

1. **Dream Lavender is the hero.** It appears in the logo, primary CTAs, active navigation states, and key brand moments. It should be immediately recognizable as "the haraya color."
2. **Twilight Blue grounds the experience.** Use it for secondary actions, informational elements, and anywhere the design needs to feel calm and trustworthy rather than whimsical.
3. **Accent colors are supporting players.** Sunset Blush, Golden Hour, and Morning Mist appear in badges, highlights, and decorative moments -- never as primary action colors.
4. **Canvas colors create the stage.** The background hierarchy is Cloud White (page) > Pearl (cards) > Whisper (inputs/sections). This subtle layering creates depth without borders.
5. **Gradients are signature.** The haraya brand uses soft gradients (Dream Lavender to Twilight Blue, Dream Lavender to Sunset Blush) as signature elements in headers, hero sections, and feature illustrations. Gradients should always feel like a soft wash, never a sharp transition.
6. **Dark mode:** Invert backgrounds to Midnight (#2A2838) with Dream Lavender and Twilight Blue accents maintained. Text becomes Pearl (#FDFCFE). Accent colors may need 10-15% brightness increase for contrast.

#### When to Use Each Font

**Playfair Display** (the dreaming voice):
- Page titles and section headings
- The haraya wordmark
- Taglines and brand messaging
- Pull quotes and editorial moments
- Real Celebration story titles
- Empty state messages and onboarding screens
- Hero text and aspirational copy

**Poppins** (the planning voice):
- Body text and paragraphs
- Navigation and UI labels
- Buttons and form elements
- Card titles and descriptions
- Data displays (budgets, stats, counts)
- Section labels (uppercase, tracked)
- Everything functional and interactive

### 3.4 Signature Visual Elements

#### The Flowing Infinity Mark

The haraya logo features a flowing infinity mark that represents:
- The endless nature of love and dreams
- Two paths (two partners) flowing together
- Continuity -- from imagination through planning to celebration and beyond

The mark is rendered in Dream Lavender on light backgrounds and Pearl on dark backgrounds. It can appear alongside the wordmark or independently as an icon/favicon.

#### Dream Gradients

Soft, luminous gradients are a signature haraya visual element.

**Primary gradient:** Dream Lavender (#9D8BD8) to Twilight Blue (#5B7C99)
- Used in: Hero sections, page headers, feature illustrations, loading states

**Warm gradient:** Dream Lavender (#9D8BD8) to Sunset Blush (#F4B8C5)
- Used in: Celebration moments, love-related features, quiz results

**Neutral gradient:** Morning Mist (#C5D5E4) to Cloud White (#F7F5FB)
- Used in: Subtle backgrounds, card hover states, section transitions

Gradients should always feel like a soft wash of color, never a hard-edged stripe. Use radial or angled linear gradients (135 degrees is the standard angle) with generous spread.

#### Shimmer Effects

A subtle shimmer animation is the haraya equivalent of the old woven border loading state. It provides visual delight during loading and transitions.

```css
@keyframes haraya-shimmer {
  0% { background-position: -200% 0; }
  100% { background-position: 200% 0; }
}

.haraya-shimmer {
  background: linear-gradient(
    90deg,
    #F7F5FB 0%,
    #9D8BD8 25%,
    #5B7C99 50%,
    #9D8BD8 75%,
    #F7F5FB 100%
  );
  background-size: 200% 100%;
  animation: haraya-shimmer 2.5s ease-in-out infinite;
}
```

Use for: Loading skeletons, progress indicators, brand moments during page transitions.

### 3.6 Imagery and Photography Direction

haraya imagery should feel:
- **Dreamy and aspirational** -- soft lighting, golden hour tones, gentle depth of field
- **Authentically Filipino** -- real Filipino couples, real Philippine venues, real cultural moments
- **Diverse and inclusive** -- variety in couple configurations, ceremony types, skin tones, body types, and celebration styles
- **Warm but not staged** -- candid emotional moments over posed perfection

Avoid:
- Stock photography that feels generic or Western
- Exclusively traditional bride-in-white-gown imagery
- Any imagery that implies a single "right" way to celebrate
- Overly saturated or heavily filtered photos

## 4. BRAND ARCHITECTURE

### 4.1 Primary Brand

**haraya** -- the celebration planning platform

The primary brand carries the full weight of the company identity. All marketing, communications, social media, and product experiences lead with haraya. The primary brand color (Dream Lavender) and the flowing infinity mark are the consistent visual anchors.

### 4.2 Sub-Brands and Features

#### Kasa (AI Assistant)

- **Name:** Kasa (lowercase in running text, capitalized when starting a sentence)
- **Meaning:** "Kasa" evokes "kasama" (companion), "kasamahan" (companionship/togetherness) -- a partner in planning
- **Role:** AI-powered planning assistant that helps couples with vendor recommendations, budget advice, timeline suggestions, and answers to Filipino wedding questions
- **Visual identity:**
  - Primary color: Twilight Blue (#5B7C99) -- differentiates from the main brand's Dream Lavender
  - Accent: Dream Lavender (#9D8BD8) for interactive elements
  - Avatar: A soft circular gradient (Twilight Blue to Dream Lavender) with a subtle sparkle icon
  - Chat bubbles: Light Twilight Blue tint background with left border accent
  - Typography: Poppins for all conversational text
- **Voice:** Knowledgeable, warm, gently witty. Kasa speaks like a well-organized friend who has helped plan dozens of Filipino celebrations. Uses Filipino terms naturally. Never condescending. Always encouraging.
- **Naming rule:** Always "Kasa" -- never "the Kasa," "Kasa AI," or "the AI assistant" in user-facing copy. In technical documentation, "Kasa (AI assistant)" is acceptable for clarity.

#### Vendor Dashboard

- **Name:** "haraya for Vendors" or "Vendor Dashboard" (in product UI)
- **Role:** The vendor-facing side of the platform -- profile management, inquiry inbox, analytics
- **Visual identity:**
  - Uses the primary haraya palette but with Twilight Blue as the dominant accent (rather than Dream Lavender) to create a professional, trustworthy feel
  - Dashboard layouts use Whisper (#EEEEF5) backgrounds for data density
  - Golden Hour (#F4C688) for vendor performance highlights and premium features
  - Typography: Poppins throughout (Playfair Display reserved for the haraya wordmark only)
- **Voice:** Professional, clear, partnership-oriented. Less dreamy, more practical. "Your profile was viewed 47 times this week" not "Dreams are converging on your profile."

#### Matchmaker Quiz

- **Name:** "Matchmaker" (in navigation) or "The haraya Matchmaker" (in marketing)
- **Role:** A 5-question visual quiz that matches couples to vendors based on celebration style, budget, location, and vibe -- generating a shareable results card
- **Visual identity:**
  - The most visually expressive feature -- uses the full Dream Lavender to Sunset Blush warm gradient
  - Quiz cards are large, visual, and image-forward
  - Results card: Designed for Instagram Stories format (1080x1920) with haraya branding, Dream Lavender gradient background, matched vendor photos, and couple's style profile
  - Share functionality uses Golden Hour (#F4C688) accent for the share button
- **Voice:** Playful and inviting. "What does your dream celebration look like?" The quiz is the most personality-forward touchpoint of the brand.

#### Couple Websites

- **Name:** "Your Website" (in product UI)
- **Role:** Simple, beautiful wedding websites couples can create and share with guests
- **Visual identity:**
  - Templates use the haraya palette but allow couples to customize accent colors
  - Default template: Cloud White background, Dream Lavender accents, Playfair Display headings
  - The haraya logo appears as a subtle "Powered by haraya" footer mark
- **Voice:** Adapts to the couple's tone. The platform provides templates and copy suggestions, but the final voice is the couple's own.

### 4.3 How the Visual System Extends

| Touchpoint | Primary Color | Typography | Emotional Register |
|------------|--------------|------------|-------------------|
| Main product (couples) | Dream Lavender | Playfair + Poppins | Dreamy, warm, aspirational |
| Kasa (AI assistant) | Twilight Blue | Poppins primary | Knowledgeable, calm, supportive |
| Vendor Dashboard | Twilight Blue dominant | Poppins primary | Professional, clear, trustworthy |
| Matchmaker Quiz | Dream Lavender to Sunset Blush gradient | Playfair for questions, Poppins for options | Playful, expressive, shareable |
| Couple Websites | Customizable (Dream Lavender default) | Playfair + Poppins (customizable) | Personal, celebratory |
| Social Media | Dream Lavender primary | Playfair for headlines, Poppins for body | Warm, inspiring, Filipino |
| Email Communications | Dream Lavender accents | Poppins primary (web-safe fallback) | Gentle, encouraging, informative |

## 5. COMPETITIVE POSITIONING

### 5.1 The Philippine Wedding Planning Landscape

The Philippine wedding industry serves approximately 370,000-415,000 couples annually, with total market value estimated between PHP 74 billion and PHP 207 billion. Despite this scale, there is no dominant digital planning platform. Couples cobble together their planning experience from Facebook groups, Instagram searches, word-of-mouth, and spreadsheets. This fragmentation is the opportunity.

### 5.2 Competitive Analysis

#### vs. Facebook Groups (Weddings PH, Budget Wedding Philippines, etc.)

**What they offer:** Zero-friction access, social proof from real people, massive reach, real-time responses.

**Where they fail:** Unsearchable (a post from 3 days ago is effectively lost), unstructured (vendor recs mix with rants and spam), no tools (no budget tracker, no checklist, no vendor comparison), no verification (anyone can recommend or trash a vendor), contradictory advice, no privacy.

**haraya's advantage:** haraya does not replace Facebook groups -- it gives couples the structured tools Facebook groups cannot provide. The positioning is not "leave your groups." It is "keep your groups for the chismis, use haraya for the actual planning." A couple can get a vendor name from a Facebook group, then look them up on haraya to see their full portfolio, pricing range, reviews, and availability -- and add them to their shortlist, their budget, and their checklist in one flow.

#### vs. Kasal.com

**What they offer:** Longevity (established 2001), wedding fair organization (Kasalang Filipino series), all-inclusive wedding packages, vendor directory, privilege card discounts.

**Where they fail:** Dated user experience that has not meaningfully evolved in years. Desktop-first design in a mobile-first market. Bride-focused language and imagery. No modern planning tools (no interactive checklist, no budget tracker). No vendor search/filter functionality comparable to modern platforms. Functions primarily as a wedding fair organizer with a web directory attached.

**haraya's advantage:** Modern, mobile-first UX designed for 2026. Interactive planning tools. Inclusive language and design from the ground up. AI-powered assistant (Kasa). Vendor profiles with portfolio galleries, pricing transparency, and structured inquiry forms. The experience gap between Kasal.com and haraya is generational.

#### vs. Bride and Breakfast

**What they offer:** Strong editorial content and brand (405K Facebook followers, 228K Instagram followers). Beautiful wedding stories and vendor features. Toast Wedding Fair events. Established SEO authority for Philippine wedding content.

**Where they fail:** Fundamentally a content/media company, not a planning platform. No vendor search, no filtering, no comparison tools. No planning features (checklists, budgets, timelines). No marketplace interaction (cannot send inquiries, save favorites, or track vendors). The name itself ("Bride") signals a gendered, bride-focused perspective that limits inclusivity.

**haraya's advantage:** haraya is a platform, not a publication. Couples can browse, search, filter, compare, save, inquire, plan, and track -- all in one place. Bride and Breakfast is a potential content partner, not a competitor. haraya should approach B&B as a complementary brand: they inspire, haraya executes.

#### vs. Brideworthy

**What they offer:** Vendor directory with category browsing (venues, photographers, florists, caterers, etc.). 360-degree venue views. Direct supplier communication (no commission model). Clean, modern-ish design relative to Kasal.com.

**Where they fail:** Pink-dominated aesthetic that signals a luxury, bride-focused brand -- not inclusive by default. "Bride Worthy" as a name explicitly centers brides, excluding partners, grooms, and non-binary individuals. No planning tools. Small team (1-10 employees per public data). Limited differentiation beyond being a directory. No community features, no AI, no interactive planning.

**haraya's advantage:** Inclusive from the name down -- haraya is a gender-neutral Filipino word that speaks to everyone. Planning tools create stickiness that a directory alone cannot achieve. AI assistant (Kasa) provides personalized guidance. Matchmaker Quiz drives viral acquisition. The visual identity (Dream Lavender, ethereal aesthetic) is distinctive and aspirational without being gendered.

### 5.3 What haraya Does That No One Else Does

These five capabilities create a competitive moat that is structurally difficult to replicate:

1. **Filipino Cultural Intelligence as a Product Feature.** The checklist includes CENOMAR applications and Pre-Cana scheduling. The budget tracker uses PHP with per-head catering categories. The AI assistant (Kasa) understands ninong/ninang dynamics, same-day edit video as a vendor category, and the difference between a Catholic ceremony timeline and a Muslim nikah. No international platform can replicate this depth. No existing Philippine platform has built it.

2. **Inclusive Architecture, Not Inclusive Marketing.** The database schema uses `partner1_name` and `partner2_name`. The ceremony type enum includes `civil_union`. The default UI says "You" and "Your Partner" -- warm and personal for everyone. The "All Celebrations Welcome" badge is built into the vendor model. This is not a marketing stance; it is the engineering.

3. **AI-Powered Planning Assistant (Kasa).** No Philippine wedding platform has an AI assistant. Kasa provides personalized vendor recommendations, budget advice, and answers to the specific questions Filipino couples have -- from "How do I get a CENOMAR?" to "What is a reasonable per-head catering rate in Tagaytay?" This is a feature that gets better with every couple who uses it.

4. **The Viral Matchmaker Quiz.** A shareable, branded results card designed for Instagram Stories and Facebook sharing in a country with 94.6% Facebook penetration and 3.5 hours of daily social media usage. This is not just a feature; it is the primary organic acquisition channel.

5. **Dream-Forward Brand Identity.** In a competitive landscape of dated directories, bride-focused blogs, and pink luxury brands, haraya's ethereal lavender-and-blue identity stands alone. It signals modernity, inclusivity, and aspiration without being clinical or cold. The name itself -- a Filipino word meaning "imagination" and "dream" -- creates an emotional connection that English brand names cannot match.

### 5.4 Positioning Statement

**For Filipino couples** planning a celebration, **haraya** is the **celebration planning platform** that turns their dreams into a plan they can actually follow -- **unlike** scattered Facebook groups, outdated directories, and bride-focused blogs. **haraya** combines a curated vendor directory, intelligent planning tools, an AI assistant named Kasa, and a distinctly Filipino identity built on Dream Lavender and Twilight Blue -- **where every dream and every celebration is welcome.**

## 6. TARGET AUDIENCE

### 6.1 Primary Audience: Filipino Couples Aged 25-35

These are couples actively planning a celebration in the Philippines. They are digital natives comfortable with mobile apps and social media. They are currently using a fragmented mix of Facebook groups, Instagram, Google Sheets, and Viber group chats to plan. They want better tools but do not know they exist yet.

**Key characteristics:**
- Mobile-first: 95%+ access via smartphone, primarily Android on 4G
- Social media heavy: 3.5 hours/day average, 94.6% on Facebook, 82.2% on TikTok
- Budget range: PHP 50,000 to PHP 1,000,000+ (with the majority in PHP 100,000-500,000)
- Ceremony types: Civil (41.8% -- the largest segment), Catholic, Muslim, Church (INC), Civil Union, Other
- Planning timeline: 6-18 months before the celebration date
- Decision-making: Collaborative (both partners involved), with family influence (especially for Catholic and Muslim ceremonies)

### 6.2 Secondary Audience: Wedding Vendors

Filipino wedding vendors and service providers who want a digital presence and qualified leads. These range from solo photographers and freelance makeup artists to established venue operators and catering companies.

**Key characteristics:**
- Instagram-first for portfolio and brand building
- Facebook-dependent for lead generation (responding to inquiries in wedding groups)
- Frustrated with unqualified leads, ghosting, and price-shoppers
- Willing to try a free platform if it delivers serious couples
- Range from 1-person operations to established businesses with teams
- Categories: Venues, Photo & Video, Catering, Coordination, Hair & Makeup, Attire, Flowers & Styling, Lights & Sound

### 6.3 Tertiary Audience: OFW (Overseas Filipino Worker) Couples

Filipino couples living abroad (United States, UAE, Singapore, Saudi Arabia, Hong Kong, etc.) who are planning a celebration in the Philippines. They face unique challenges: time zone differences, inability to visit vendors in person, reliance on family members for on-the-ground coordination, and limited knowledge of current vendor landscapes.

**Key characteristics:**
- Higher budget range (remittance income)
- Planning from a distance (need excellent vendor profiles with photos and reviews)
- Active in overseas Filipino Facebook communities
- Willing to pay premium for convenience and trust
- Often planning a destination-style celebration in their home province

### 6.4 User Personas

#### Persona 1: Mia and JR -- The Digital-First Metro Couple

- **Ceremony:** Civil ceremony followed by a garden reception in Tagaytay
- **Budget:** PHP 350,000
- **Planning status:** Just engaged, 12 months out
- **Current tools:** Instagram for venue inspiration, Viber group with friends, Google Sheets for budget
- **Pain points:** Cannot compare vendors easily, overwhelmed by contradictory advice in Facebook groups, want transparent pricing, tired of DMing vendors on Instagram only to wait days for a reply
- **What haraya gives them:** A single platform to browse, compare, and contact vendors. A budget tracker that auto-calculates. A checklist that knows they need a CENOMAR. A matchmaker quiz they share on Instagram Stories.

#### Persona 2: Bea and Carla -- The Inclusive Couple

- **Ages:** 27 and 29
- **Location:** Quezon City, Metro Manila
- **Ceremony:** Civil union (when legislation passes) or civil ceremony with a celebration in a boutique venue
- **Budget:** PHP 200,000
- **Planning status:** Actively planning, 8 months out
- **Current tools:** LGBTQ+ Facebook groups, word of mouth from friends who have celebrated
- **Pain points:** Most wedding platforms assume "bride and groom." Finding vendors who are genuinely welcoming is exhausting -- they have to vet every vendor individually. They want to plan without feeling like they are an exception.
- **What haraya gives them:** A platform that says "You and Your Partner" from the first screen. An "All Celebrations Welcome" badge that immediately identifies welcoming vendors. A community where their celebration is normal, not remarkable. They never have to explain themselves.

#### Persona 3: Chef Marga -- The Mid-Range Caterer

- **Age:** 42
- **Location:** Paranaque, Metro Manila
- **Business:** Catering company specializing in Filipino fusion cuisine, 8 years in business
- **Price range:** PHP 450-800 per head
- **Current marketing:** Facebook business page, Instagram, Kasal.com listing (rarely updated), wedding fair booth twice a year
- **Pain points:** 70% of inquiries from Facebook never convert. Couples ask for prices but ghost. She wants serious leads from couples who have already decided on a budget and a date. She also wants her lechon station and kare-kare to be showcased properly.
- **What haraya gives her:** A professional profile page with portfolio gallery, service descriptions, and transparent pricing. Structured inquiry forms that require couples to share their date, guest count, and budget range. The "All Celebrations Welcome" badge she proudly opts into. Qualified leads, not tire-kickers.

#### Persona 4: Mike and Rina -- The OFW Couple

- **Ages:** 32 and 30
- **Location:** Dubai, UAE (planning a celebration in Cebu)
- **Ceremony:** Catholic church ceremony in Cebu City followed by a beach reception
- **Budget:** PHP 800,000
- **Planning status:** 15 months out, just started research
- **Current tools:** Facebook groups for OFW couples, family members visiting venues on their behalf, WhatsApp with a Cebu-based coordinator
- **Pain points:** Cannot visit venues or meet vendors in person. Need detailed vendor profiles with photos and reviews. Need a coordinator but do not know who to trust. Time zone makes communication difficult.
- **What haraya gives them:** Rich vendor profiles they can browse at 2am Dubai time. A planning checklist that accounts for the extra lead time needed for international documentation. Kasa (AI assistant) that answers questions about Cebu vendors and Catholic ceremony requirements. A single platform where their Cebu-based coordinator can also access their plans.

### 7.3 Public Launch (Weeks 5-6)

**Objective:** Full public availability. Media coverage. Establish haraya as a recognizable brand in the Philippine wedding space.

**Activities:**

| Activity | Details |
|----------|---------|
| Public launch announcement | "haraya is live. Where dreams take shape." Full social media campaign across all platforms. |
| PR push | Press release with screenshots, brand assets, and founder interviews. Target: Tech in Asia, Rappler, Philippine Star Lifestyle, CNN Philippines, Entrepreneur PH, ABS-CBN Lifestyle. Multiple PR angles (see below). |

| Media Type | Angle | Target Outlets |
|------------|-------|---------------|
| Tech/Startup | "Filipino startup haraya uses AI to reimagine wedding planning" | Tech in Asia, e27, Rappler Tech |
| Lifestyle/Wedding | "New platform celebrates every Filipino love story with tools that actually work" | Bride and Breakfast, Preview, Esquire PH |
| Culture | "haraya: the Filipino word for 'dream' becomes a wedding planning platform" | CNN Philippines, ABS-CBN Lifestyle, Philippine Star Lifestyle |
| LGBTQ+/Social | "As civil union bills advance, haraya welcomes all celebrations" | Rappler, Vice Asia, Outrage Magazine PH |
| Business | "PHP 100B+ Filipino wedding market gets its first modern planning platform" | Business World, Inquirer Business, Entrepreneur PH |

### 7.4 Growth Phase (Months 2-6)

**Objective:** Sustain momentum. Grow both sides of the marketplace. Build SEO authority. Expand geographically beyond NCR.

**Key Growth Levers:**

1. **Matchmaker Quiz as Viral Engine.** Target: 20% share rate. Every quiz completion generates a branded card designed for Instagram Stories. Filipino social behavior is inherently communal -- when someone shares their quiz results, their engaged friends take the quiz too. This is the primary organic acquisition loop.

2. **Content-Driven SEO.** Publish the "haraya Filipino Wedding Report" with data-driven insights on costs, trends, and regional differences. Target high-search keywords: "how much does a Filipino wedding cost," "Pre-Cana seminar requirements," "Catholic wedding checklist Philippines." Become the authoritative source Filipino media cites.

3. **Vendor Network Effects.** As more vendors join, the directory becomes more valuable to couples. As more couples join, the leads become more valuable to vendors. Target: 200 vendor listings by Month 3, 500 by Month 6. Begin including Cebu, Davao, and Clark/Pampanga vendors.

4. **Wedding Fair Strategy.** Attend (do not exhibit) major wedding fairs: The Wedding Library Bridal Fair (WTC Manila, 350+ suppliers), Getting Married Bridal Fair (SMX), Toast Wedding Fair (Bride and Breakfast). Pre-fair: scrape exhibitor list, create haraya listings. At-fair: approach vendors with tablet showing their listing. Post-fair: email unclaimed vendors.

5. **Community Building.** Grow the "haraya Couples" Facebook group as a bridge community. Transition to in-app community features when critical mass is achieved (500+ active users). Never launch in-app community before it can sustain itself -- empty forums are worse than no forums.

6. **Product Expansion.** Launch Kasa (AI assistant) in Month 4-5. Launch Couple Websites in Month 5-6. Each new feature creates a new reason to return and a new surface for acquisition.

---

## 8. CONTENT STRATEGY

### 8.1 Content Pillars

All haraya content maps to one of five pillars:

| Pillar | Purpose | Content Types | Platform Focus |
|--------|---------|---------------|---------------|
| **Dream Inspiration** | Inspire couples with what is possible | Real Celebration stories, venue tours, styled shoot features, "dream board" visual content | Instagram, Pinterest (future) |
| **Planning Power** | Provide practical tools and knowledge | Checklist guides, budget breakdowns, vendor selection tips, timeline templates, CENOMAR guides | Blog/SEO, Facebook, TikTok |
| **Vendor Spotlights** | Showcase vendors and build supply-side value | Vendor profiles, behind-the-scenes features, "meet the vendor" interviews | Instagram, Facebook, haraya blog |
| **Filipino Wedding Culture** | Establish authority and cultural credibility | Pre-Cana guides, ninong/ninang etiquette, ceremony type comparisons, regional tradition features | Blog/SEO, TikTok, Facebook |
| **Community Voices** | Build trust through real stories and real people | Couple testimonials, "how we planned" stories, user-generated content, Q&A sessions | All platforms, especially Facebook and TikTok |

### 8.2 Social Media Approach

#### Instagram (@haraya.ph)

**Role:** Brand home. Aspirational content. Visual storytelling.

**Content mix:**
- 40% Dream Inspiration (Reels: venue tours, celebration highlights, styled content)
- 25% Vendor Spotlights (carousels: vendor portfolio highlights, "5 questions with...")
- 20% Planning Power (carousels: tips, checklists, budget breakdowns)
- 15% Community Voices (Stories: couple Q&As, user-generated content, polls)

**Posting cadence:** 4-5 posts/week + daily Stories

**Visual guidelines:** All posts use the haraya color palette. Dream Lavender accent on all branded graphics. Consistent use of Playfair Display for headlines and Poppins for body text. Photography should feel warm, dreamy, and authentically Filipino.

#### TikTok (@haraya.ph)

**Role:** Discovery engine. Virality. Reach new audiences.

**Content mix:**
- 35% Planning Power ("Things no one tells you about planning a Filipino wedding," "How much does X really cost?")
- 30% Filipino Wedding Culture (ceremony type explainers, tradition features, "Filipino wedding things that confuse foreigners")
- 20% Community Voices ("How we planned our wedding in 6 months," couple duets)
- 15% Behind the Scenes (building haraya, founder story, product reveals)

**Posting cadence:** 3-5 videos/week

**Approach:** Use natural Taglish (Filipino-English code-switching). Prioritize trending audio. Short-form (15-60 seconds). Educational entertainment. Matchmaker Quiz results optimized for TikTok format.

#### Facebook (@haraya.ph + haraya Couples Group)

**Role:** Community hub. Awareness. Older demographic reach.

**Content mix:**
- 30% Planning Power (articles, tips, checklist guides)
- 25% Community Voices (couple stories, discussions in haraya Couples group)
- 20% Vendor Spotlights (vendor features, special offers)
- 15% Dream Inspiration (celebration stories, photo features)
- 10% Platform Updates (new features, announcements)

**Posting cadence:** 5-7 posts/week on Page + daily engagement in haraya Couples group

**Approach:** Facebook remains the #1 platform in the Philippines by penetration (94.6%). The haraya Page is for brand awareness; the haraya Couples closed group is for community and engagement. In external wedding Facebook groups (Weddings PH, Budget Wedding Philippines), the team provides value first -- answering questions, sharing tips -- without spamming haraya links.

### 8.3 SEO Keywords

**Tier 1 (High Volume, High Intent):**
- wedding planning Philippines
- wedding venues Metro Manila
- wedding venues Tagaytay
- how much does a Filipino wedding cost
- wedding photographer Philippines
- wedding caterer Manila
- budget wedding Philippines

**Tier 2 (Medium Volume, High Intent):**
- Pre-Cana seminar requirements Philippines
- CENOMAR requirements
- Catholic wedding checklist Philippines
- civil wedding requirements Philippines
- wedding coordinator Manila
- Cebu wedding venues
- wedding budget tracker

**Tier 3 (Low Volume, High Specificity):**
- Muslim wedding (nikah) Philippines
- civil union Philippines 2026
- LGBTQ friendly wedding vendors Philippines
- same-day edit wedding video Philippines
- ninong ninang etiquette
- Barong Tagalog wedding
- destination wedding Boracay / Palawan / Siargao

**SEO Content Strategy:**
- Publish 2-4 long-form articles per month targeting Tier 1 and Tier 2 keywords
- Each vendor profile page is SEO-optimized with structured data (schema.org)
- The "haraya Filipino Wedding Report" becomes the annual authoritative data source for media citations
- Blog content is gated behind zero friction (no email required to read) to maximize organic reach and trust

## 9. METRICS AND SUCCESS CRITERIA

### 9.1 North Star Metric

**Vendor inquiries sent per week.**

This single metric captures both sides of the marketplace. If couples are sending inquiries, they found vendors worth contacting. If vendors are receiving inquiries, the platform is delivering value. Every product decision, every marketing campaign, and every feature release should be evaluated against its impact on this number.

### 9.2 KPIs at 3 Months Post-Launch

| Metric | Target | What It Proves |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| Registered couples | 500 | Acquisition channels are working |
| Weekly active couples (WAU) | 150 (30% of MAU) | Retention is healthy -- people are coming back |
| Vendor listings (total) | 200 | Supply side has critical mass for meaningful browsing |
| Claimed vendor profiles | 50 | Vendors are actively engaged, not just passively listed |
| Vendor inquiries sent (total) | 300+ | Marketplace interaction is real |
| Vendor inquiries per week | 50+ (and accelerating) | Growth rate is increasing |
| Matchmaker Quiz completions | 1,000 | Top-of-funnel engagement works |
| Quiz result share rate | 20%+ | Viral loop is proven |
| Checklist items completed | 2,000+ total | Planning tools are sticky |
| Organic search traffic | 1,000+ monthly visits | SEO authority is building |
| NPS score | 40+ | Strong recommendation likelihood |
| At least 1 vendor reports a booking from haraya | Yes/No | Actual marketplace value delivered |

### 9.3 KPIs at 6 Months Post-Launch

| Metric | Target | What It Proves |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| Registered couples | 2,000 | Sustained growth beyond launch |
| Monthly active couples (MAU) | 800 | Platform is part of planning routine |
| Vendor listings | 500 | Supply side expanding organically (vendors requesting to be listed) |
| Claimed vendor profiles | 150 | Active vendor community forming |
| Vendor inquiries per week | 100+ | Marketplace is thriving |
| Matchmaker Quiz completions | 5,000 total | Top-of-funnel is a reliable engine |
| Kasa (AI assistant) conversations | 500/month | AI feature is delivering value |
| Organic search traffic | 5,000+ monthly visits | SEO authority is strong |
| Media mentions | 5+ | Brand is recognized in the industry |
| Geographic expansion | NCR + CALABARZON + Cebu | Regional growth is underway |

### 9.4 KPIs at 12 Months Post-Launch

| Metric | Target | What It Proves |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| Registered couples | 8,000 | Market penetration is meaningful (2%+ of annual PH weddings) |
| Monthly active couples | 3,000 | Retention and engagement at scale |
| Vendor listings | 1,500 | Comprehensive directory for major regions |
| Claimed vendor profiles | 500 | Vendor ecosystem is self-sustaining |
| Vendor inquiries per week | 300+ | Marketplace is delivering real business value |
| Revenue (optional by Month 12) | PHP 50,000/month from premium vendor features | Business model is validated |
| NPS score | 50+ | Platform is genuinely loved |
| The "haraya Filipino Wedding Report" cited by media | 3+ citations | Authority play is working |
| Team size | 5-8 people | Growth justifies investment |

### 9.5 What We Do NOT Optimize For (Yet)

| Metric | Why We Ignore It For Now |
|--------|------------------------|
| Revenue (first 6 months) | Growth over monetization. Charging too early kills the marketplace flywheel. |
| Vendor count above 500 (first 6 months) | Quality over quantity. 500 excellent profiles beats 2,000 stale listings. |
| Feature count | Ship fewer features better, not more features worse. |
| App downloads | No native app planned for Year 1. Responsive web + PWA is sufficient. |
| International expansion | Philippines first. Prove the model domestically before looking abroad. |

## 10. BRAND RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

These rules apply to ALL code, UI copy, marketing materials, social media content, vendor communications, email templates, documentation, and internal communications. No exceptions.

### Rule 1: Always "haraya" in Lowercase

The brand name is always written as `haraya` -- one word, all lowercase, no exceptions.

| Correct | Incorrect |
|---------|-----------|
| haraya | Haraya |
| haraya | HARAYA |
| haraya | HaRaYa |
| haraya | Hara Ya |
| haraya | hara-ya |

In contexts where capitalization is forced by the platform (e.g., the start of a sentence in a social media post where lowercase may look like a typo), the preferred approach is to restructure the sentence so that "haraya" does not appear at the start. If unavoidable, use lowercase anyway and let the brand consistency speak for itself.

### Rule 2: Never Assume Gender

haraya is built for every couple. The platform never assumes the gender, orientation, or relationship structure of its users.

| Instead Of | Use |
|------------|-----|
| Bride / Groom | "You" and "Your Partner" (default) |
| Bride's checklist | Your checklist |
| Bridal party | Wedding party / Your crew |
| Maid of Honor / Best Man | (Customizable role names) |
| Mr. and Mrs. | (Couple's chosen title) |
| Bride and groom | The couple / The partners |
| Bridesmaids / Groomsmen | Attendants / Wedding party |
| His and hers | Theirs / Both partners |
| Wedding | Celebration (where appropriate and natural) |

**Default partner labels:** "You" and "Your Partner" in all UI contexts. Couples can customize to their names, "Bride/Groom" (if they want traditional terms), or any custom text. The platform never forces terminology on anyone.

**The `CoupleProfile` type:** Uses `partner1Name` and `partner2Name`. Never `brideName` and `groomName`.

### Rule 3: "All Celebrations Welcome" Badge

Vendors can opt in to display the "All Celebrations Welcome" badge on their profile, signaling that they welcome all couples regardless of gender, orientation, or ceremony type.

- Badge background: Dream Lavender (#9D8BD8)
- Badge text: Pearl (#FDFCFE), Poppins 500, uppercase, 0.05em letter-spacing
- Badge is a boolean (`allCelebrationsWelcome`) on the Vendor type
- Displayed on vendor cards and vendor profile pages
- Badge is opt-in only -- vendors are never required or pressured to display it
- The badge is NOT the centerpiece of the brand. It is a signal that some couples look for and others simply do not notice.

### Rule 4: Ceremony Types Must Be Inclusive

The platform supports the following ceremony types, and this list must appear in full wherever ceremony type selection is offered:

- Catholic
- Church (INC)
- Church (Other)
- Muslim
- Civil
- Civil Union
- Other

**Never default to Catholic.** Always let the user choose. If no choice is made, the system should either prompt for a selection or provide a generic (non-ceremony-specific) experience.

In the Checklist and Budget tools, ceremony type filters the visible items. Catholic-specific items (Pre-Cana, arrhae, church fees) appear only when Catholic is selected. Muslim-specific items (nikah, mahr) appear only when Muslim is selected. Civil and Civil Union share most items. "Other" shows all items so the couple can choose what applies.

### Rule 5: Filipino-Specific Terminology

The following Filipino terms MUST be used correctly throughout the platform. They are part of haraya's cultural intelligence and should never be replaced with English approximations.

| Term | Definition | Context |
|------|-----------|---------|
| **CENOMAR** | Certificate of No Marriage, issued by the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) | Documentation checklist, Kasa guidance |
| **Pre-Cana** | Pre-marriage counseling seminar required by the Catholic Church | Catholic ceremony checklist, Kasa guidance |
| **Ninong / Ninang** | Principal sponsors (godfather/godmother) in a Filipino wedding | Checklist items, entourage management |
| **Arrhae** | 13 wedding coins used in Catholic Filipino wedding ceremonies | Catholic ceremony checklist |
| **Lechon** | Roast pig, a staple at Filipino celebrations | Catering vendor context, budget categories |
| **Mahr** | Dowry or gift from the groom to the bride in Muslim weddings | Muslim ceremony checklist |
| **Nikah** | The Muslim marriage ceremony | Muslim ceremony context |
| **Barong Tagalog** | Traditional Filipino formal wear for men | Attire vendor context |
| **Filipiniana** | Traditional Filipino formal attire (especially for women) | Attire vendor context |
| **Same-Day Edit (SDE)** | A video highlight of the wedding shown during the reception, edited in real-time | Photo & Video vendor context |
| **Cord / Veil / Arrhae sponsors** | Secondary sponsors who participate in the Catholic ceremony | Catholic ceremony checklist |
| **Tita / Tito** | Aunt / Uncle -- used broadly for older family friends | Content voice, relatable copy |
| **Pamanhikan** | A traditional Filipino custom where the groom's family visits the bride's family to formally ask for her hand | Checklist, cultural content |

### Rule 6: Currency Is Always PHP

All monetary values on the platform are in Philippine Pesos (PHP).

- Format: `PHP X,XXX` with the PHP prefix, or `₱X,XXX` with the peso sign
- Use `toLocaleString('en-PH')` for number formatting in code
- Budget ranges: Display as "₱100,000 - ₱300,000" or "PHP 100,000 - PHP 300,000"
- Per-head catering: Display as "₱450 - ₱800 per head"
- Never display prices in USD, EUR, or any other currency on the Philippine platform

### Rule 7: haraya Taglines

The following taglines are approved for use in the specified contexts:

| Tagline | Use In |
|---------|--------|
| "where dreams take shape" | Primary tagline. Homepage hero. Email signatures. Social media bios. Branded materials. |
| "imagine your celebration" | Onboarding, quiz entry points, aspirational moments |
| "every dream, every celebration" | Inclusive messaging, diversity-forward contexts |
| "dream it. plan it. celebrate it." | Feature marketing, product overviews, action-oriented contexts |
| "your celebration, beautifully imagined" | Premium contexts, aspirational marketing |

**Retired taglines (never use):**
- "plan together, celebrate forevr"
- "where forevr begins"
- "six threads. one platform. every couple."
- "for every couple. every love story. every celebration."

### Rule 8: Social Media Handles

| Platform | Handle |
|----------|--------|
| Instagram | @haraya.ph |
| TikTok | @haraya.ph |
| Facebook | @haraya.ph |
| Email | hello@haraya.ph |
| Website | haraya.ph |

### Rule 9: Color Consistency

Dream Lavender (#9D8BD8) is the defining haraya color. It must appear in every branded touchpoint:
- As the primary CTA color in the product
- In the logo/wordmark
- As an accent in every social media post
- In email headers and footers
- In press materials and brand assets

Twilight Blue (#5B7C99) is the grounding color. It supports Dream Lavender but never replaces it as the primary.

The previous brand colors (Heritage Red #8B3A3A, Pina Ivory #F5EDD8, T'nalak Black #2A2520, and all textile-specific palettes) are fully retired and must not appear in any new haraya materials.

### Rule 10: Typography Consistency

- Headings: Playfair Display (never Cormorant Garamond, which is retired)
- Body: Poppins (never Jost, which is retired)
- These typefaces must be used consistently across all platforms
- For contexts where custom fonts cannot be loaded (plain text emails, SMS), use system defaults
- Never use more than these two typefaces in any haraya-branded material

### Rule 11: The Woven Heritage System Is Retired

The following elements from the previous brand identity are fully retired and must not appear in any haraya context:

- The six-textile color mapping (Pina, T'nalak, Inabel, Hablon, Yakan, Langkit)
- The woven border (6px multicolor horizontal stripe)
- Textile background patterns (.pattern-pina, .pattern-inabel, etc.)
- Section-to-textile color rules
- The Dropped-E signature (forevr, discovr, togethr, remembr)
- Heritage Red (#8B3A3A) as a brand color
- The Jost + Cormorant Garamond type system
- Warm ivory/cream backgrounds (#FDFAF3, #F5EDD8)
- The e-a monogram logo

These elements may persist in the codebase during the transition period but must be systematically replaced. No new code, content, or design should reference them.

### Rule 12: Kasa Is the AI Assistant

The AI assistant is named "Kasa" (not "Ate AI," not "Tulay," not "the AI assistant" in user-facing copy).

- Always "Kasa" with a capital K (it is a proper name, unlike the brand name "haraya")
- In product UI: "Ask Kasa" / "Kasa suggests..." / "Chat with Kasa"
- In technical documentation: "Kasa (AI assistant)" for clarity
- Voice: warm, knowledgeable, gently witty, uses Filipino terms naturally
- Never robotic or corporate in tone

### Rule 13: Photography and Imagery

All photography used in haraya materials must:
- Feature real Filipino people and real Philippine settings
- Include diversity in couple configurations, ceremony types, skin tones, body types, and celebration styles
- Feel warm, dreamy, and authentic -- not overly staged or clinical
- Never use exclusively bride-in-white imagery as the default representation of celebration
- Credit photographers and source materials appropriately

### Rule 14: Accessibility

- All text must meet WCAG AA contrast ratios (4.5:1 for body text, 3:1 for large text)
- Color must never be the sole indicator of state (important for the 8% of males with color vision deficiency)
- All interactive elements must be keyboard accessible
- All images must have meaningful alt text
- Badge font sizes must be at least 11px
- Touch targets on mobile must be at least 44x44 pixels
