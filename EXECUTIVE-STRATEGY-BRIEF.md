## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### The Opportunity

The Philippine wedding industry serves approximately 370,000-415,000 couples annually with budgets ranging from PHP 50,000 to over PHP 1,000,000 -- yet there is no dominant digital platform serving them. The existing landscape is fragmented across aging directories (Kasal.com, founded 2001), content blogs (Bride and Breakfast), and Facebook groups that function as chaotic, unsearchable substitutes for actual planning tools. International platforms like TheKnot, Zola, and Bridestory have either ignored the Philippines entirely or invested only peripherally. This is a clear, time-limited window.

### The Strategy

everaftr will become the best way to plan a Filipino wedding by launching a vendor discovery engine paired with lightweight planning tools -- designed mobile-first, culturally rooted in six Filipino textile traditions, and inclusive by default for every couple. We will solve the cold-start problem by seeding 100 vendor listings from public data before inviting a single couple, then use the Matchmaker Quiz as a viral growth engine through Filipino social media. We will not build everything; we will build the right things first, prove marketplace dynamics within 90 days, and expand from there.

### The Key Risk and Mitigation

The greatest risk is the cold-start marketplace problem: no couples without vendors, no vendors without couples. We mitigate this by pre-populating 100 vendor listings from publicly available data (Instagram, Facebook, Google Maps), giving the platform immediate utility from day one, and running a "Founding Couples" soft launch to generate activity before public launch.

## 2. MARKET REALITY

### 2.1 The Philippine Wedding Market

| Data Point | Figure | Source |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Registered marriages (2024) | 371,825 | Philippine Statistics Authority |
| Peak wedding months | February (12.4%), June (12.1%) | PSA |
| Average wedding budget (middle-class) | PHP 300,000-700,000 | Multiple sources |
| Budget wedding range | PHP 50,000-200,000 | Regional data, Cebu/provincial |
| Premium wedding range | PHP 1,000,000-3,000,000+ | Metro Manila, destination |
| #1 ceremony type | Civil (41.8%) | PSA |
| Filipino Facebook penetration | 94.6% | DataReportal 2026 |
| Average daily social media time | 3 hours 34 minutes | DataReportal 2026 |

**Critical insight:** Civil ceremonies are the #1 type at 41.8%. This means the largest segment of marrying couples is NOT deeply tied to church-based vendor networks. They are exactly the couples most likely to plan digitally and to be receptive to a modern, inclusive platform.

### 2.2 The Competitive Landscape -- What Exists

| Platform | Founded | What It Is | Strength | Fatal Weakness |
|----------|---------|-----------|----------|----------------|
| **Kasal.com** | 2001 | Directory + bridal fair organizer | Longevity, fair events | Outdated UX, no planning tools, no couple dashboard |
| **Bride and Breakfast** | 2010 | Editorial wedding blog | 405K FB, 228K IG, strong SEO, runs Toast Wedding Fair | Content only -- not a platform. No tools, no marketplace. Bride-focused name/language |
| **Weddings At Work** | ~2005 | Community eGroup for brides/grooms | Vendor-free discussion space, loyal community | Basic technology, no tools, no vendor marketplace |
| **Bridestory** | 2014 | Indonesian wedding marketplace | GoTo Group backing, regional scale | PH is a secondary market; last PH trends report was 2017. Ghost town for PH vendors. |
| **Nuptials.ph** | N/A | Blog + vendor listings | Good SEO, wedding website feature | Fundamentally a blog, not a platform |
| **EventNest.ph** | Recent | Vendor discovery | Cleaner design, multi-region | Newer entrant, limited traction |
| **Facebook Groups** | Always | The de facto planning tool | Zero friction, social proof from real friends, massive reach | Chaotic, unsearchable, no tools, no verification, contradictory advice, posts get buried |

**The defining competitive insight:** No existing Philippine platform offers what TheKnot or Zola provide in the US. The Philippines has directories and blogs. It has zero integrated planning platforms. This is not a "slightly better" opportunity -- it is a category creation opportunity.

### 2.3 What We Learn from TheKnot (What They Do Well)

1. **Interconnected ecosystem.** The checklist drives you to the budget tool, which drives you to vendor search, which drives you to booking, which feeds the guest list. Everything links to everything. This "progressive engagement" model is the core retention mechanism. We must replicate this architecture from day one.

2. **Free for couples, vendor-funded.** Couples pay nothing. Revenue comes entirely from the vendor side. This maximizes the demand side of the marketplace. We adopt this model.

3. **Style Quiz as onboarding.** TheKnot's Style Quiz identifies the couple's aesthetic, then feeds personalized vendor and inspiration recommendations. This is low-friction, high-engagement, and generates valuable data. Our Matchmaker Quiz is the everaftr equivalent, adapted for Filipino preferences.

4. **AI-first evolution.** TheKnot just launched a ChatGPT app (February 2026) and deployed "Make it Yours" visual AI matching in September 2025. This signals the direction of the industry. We will not launch with AI, but our architecture must be AI-ready.

5. **Data as moat.** TheKnot owns geo-specific wedding cost data, 14.6M reviews, and 1M+ images. Whoever builds the Philippine wedding data repository first -- average costs by region, vendor reviews, real celebration stories -- owns the market authority.

### 2.4 What We Learn from TheKnot (What They Do Badly -- And Must Avoid)

1. **Pay-to-play vendor ranking.** Higher spend equals better search position, not quality or reviews. This creates vendor resentment (Trustpilot: 1.4/5 stars, F rating from BBB, class action lawsuit filed April 2025). **Decision: everaftr will use merit-based ranking -- review quality, response rate, profile completeness -- with transparent optional boost.**

2. **Spray-and-pray inquiry system.** Hitched.co.uk (same parent company) lets couples mass-contact 6 vendors with one click, creating a 92% ghosting rate. Vendors report 50:1 inquiry-to-booking ratios. **Decision: everaftr will require couples to invest effort per inquiry -- date, budget range, guest count, and a personal message are required fields. One inquiry at a time. Quality over quantity.**

3. **Aggressive long-term contracts.** 12-month auto-renewing contracts that vendors cannot cancel. This is the #1 source of vendor fury. **Decision: everaftr will never use long-term contracts. Month-to-month only, cancel anytime, vendor owns their profile completely.**

4. **Dated community features.** Both TheKnot and Hitched run legacy forums that feel like 2005. Users have migrated to Mumsnet, Reddit, and Facebook groups for actual community. **Decision: We will not launch community forums until we have critical mass. Empty forums are worse than no forums.**

5. **No cultural specificity.** TheKnot assumes American wedding norms. There is no understanding of ninongs/ninangs, Pre-Cana seminars, arrhae coins, Viber group coordination, same-day edit videos, or lechon debates. **Decision: Filipino cultural intelligence is our core moat and it runs through every feature.**

### 2.5 The Facebook Group Problem

Facebook groups (Weddings PH, Budget Wedding Philippines, Weddings At Work, etc.) are the single biggest "competitor" -- not because they are good, but because they are free, frictionless, and already have the users.

**Why couples use them:**
- Zero barrier to entry
- Social proof from actual friends and family
- Real-time responses from hundreds of members
- Vendor recommendations with emotional context ("Chef Marga saved my wedding!")

**Why they fail couples:**
- Unsearchable. A post from 3 days ago is effectively lost forever.
- Unstructured. Vendor recommendations mix with budget debates, rants, and promotional spam.
- No tools. No budget tracking, no checklist, no vendor comparison, no RSVP management.
- No verification. Anyone can recommend (or trash) a vendor. Competitor reviews are common.
- Contradictory advice. One person says PHP 300K is enough; the next says it is impossible.
- No privacy. Your entire extended family can see you posting about wedding stress.

**How everaftr solves this:**
everaftr does not replace Facebook groups -- it gives couples the structured tools that Facebook groups cannot provide. The positioning is not "leave your groups." It is "keep your groups for the chismis, use everaftr for the actual planning." A couple can get a vendor name from a Facebook group, then look them up on everaftr to see their full portfolio, pricing range, reviews, and availability -- and add them to their shortlist, their budget, and their checklist in one flow.

---

## 3. THE EVERAFTR POSITIONING (Revised)

### 3.1 Addressing the Devil's Advocate Head-On

The devil's advocate report raised legitimate concerns about leading with inclusivity in a predominantly Catholic country. The core argument: making LGBTQ+ inclusivity the headline brand identity risks alienating 95% of the addressable market before they ever try the product. The likely reaction of a straight Filipino couple seeing "Partner 1 / Partner 2" is not outrage -- it is confusion, followed by "this isn't for me," followed by closing the tab.

**We accept this critique. The positioning hierarchy is hereby revised.**

### 3.2 Revised Positioning Hierarchy

**LEAD WITH:**
"The best way to plan a Filipino wedding."

This is the primary message. It is the homepage hero. It is what people tell their friends. It is what shows up in search results. The value proposition is functional: better vendor discovery, better planning tools, better than Facebook groups.

**BUILT INTO:**
"Inclusive by design."

Inclusivity is a design principle, not a marketing headline. The platform works for every couple because of how it is built -- not because it shouts about it. This is the Airbnb model: structurally inclusive without broadcasting it as the thesis statement.

**EARNED THROUGH:**
"The platform that sees every love story."

Once users experience the product and discover that it works beautifully for them regardless of who they are, the inclusivity narrative earns its place through word-of-mouth, Real Celebrations stories, and organic advocacy from the LGBTQ+ community.

### 3.3 The "Viber Group" Test

Why would a couple use everaftr instead of their existing Viber group, Facebook groups, and Google Sheets?

| What They Do Now | Time/Effort | What everaftr Does | Advantage |
|-----------------|-------------|-------------------|-----------|
| Screenshot vendor names from FB groups, search them on IG | 2-3 hours per vendor | Browse vendors with portfolios, pricing, and reviews in one place | 10x faster vendor discovery |
| Build a Google Sheet for budget tracking | 3-4 hours setup, constant manual updates | Pre-built budget tracker with Filipino category templates and running totals | Instant setup, auto-calculations |
| Call 5 parishes to find Pre-Cana availability | Full afternoon | Checklist with Filipino-specific items (CENOMAR, Pre-Cana, ninong confirmations) | Know what you need, when you need it |
| DM vendors one by one on Instagram, wait days for replies | Weeks of back-and-forth | Send structured inquiry with date, budget, guest count -- vendor gets a qualified lead | Better for both sides |
| Compare vendors by scrolling through 500 Facebook comments | Impossible | Filter by location, price range, category, badges -- side by side | Finally searchable |

### 3.4 Cultural Positioning: Filipino-First, Not Progressive-First

everaftr is not an advocacy platform with planning tools attached. It is a planning platform that happens to work for everyone.

**What "Filipino-first" means in practice:**
- The checklist includes "Apply for CENOMAR," "Book Pre-Cana seminar," "Confirm ninong/ninang list with church," and "Order arrhae coins" -- not American items like "book rehearsal dinner venue."
- Budget templates reflect Filipino realities: PHP 50K-200K budget weddings exist and are valid. Catering is per-head (PHP 450-800 is the mid-range), not per-plate.
- The design system draws from six Filipino textile traditions, not generic pastels or Pinterest aesthetics.
- The platform understands that wedding planning in the Philippines is communal -- family members, ninongs/ninangs, and coordinators are all part of the process.
- Ceremony types include Catholic, INC, Muslim, Civil, Civil Union, and Other -- because the Philippines has all of these.
- The AI assistant (future) will know what a "same-day edit" is, why the mother of the bride picks the principal sponsors, and how to handle a guest list that ballooned from 100 to 180 because of tita politics.

## 4. BRANDING DECISIONS (Final)

### 4.1 What Stays from the Brand Guide

The Woven Heritage concept is the strongest element of the entire brand system. It immediately differentiates everaftr from every other wedding platform globally. It is confirmed and final.

**Confirmed elements:**
- **Brand name:** `everaftr` (lowercase, one word, always)
- **Woven Heritage design system:** Six textiles mapped to six sections
- **Color system:** All CSS variables as defined in the brand guide
- **Typography:** Jost (functional) + Cormorant Garamond (emotional)
- **Woven border:** 6px multicolor signature element at top of every page
- **Textile background patterns:** Subtle CSS-only textures at 0.03-0.08 opacity
- **Heritage Red (#8B3A3A)** as global brand accent
- **Warm background (#FDFAF3)** as app background -- distinctly not cold-white tech
- **Card style:** 8px border-radius, borders not shadows, shadows only on hover
- **Dropped-E signature** in brand name and tagline only

### 4.2 What Changes Based on Brand Reviewer Feedback

The brand reviewer identified specific issues. Here are the decisions:

**1. Tagline Swap**
- **OLD primary tagline:** "where forevr begins" (poetic but vague -- does not communicate what the platform does)
- **NEW primary tagline:** "plan together, celebrate forevr" (has a verb, implies partnership, hints at function)
- "where forevr begins" demoted to secondary -- used for splash screens, email headers, emotional moments, but NOT as homepage hero copy
- **Homepage hero text:** "The best way to plan a Filipino wedding." (Clear, functional, immediately understood)

**2. Dropped-E Restriction**
- Dropped-E applies ONLY to: `everaftr`, `forevr` (tagline), and ONE campaign word at a time
- **Never** use dropped-E in navigation labels, button text, or functional UI copy
- "Discover vendors" is correct. "Discovr vendors" is incorrect in a nav bar.
- Rationale: Rayner et al. research on eye movements shows misspelled words trigger fixation pauses. Acceptable in a brand name; creates friction in UI labels.

**3. Accessibility Fixes (Mandatory)**
- `--text-secondary` changed from `#6B5E52` (4.2:1 ratio, fails WCAG AA) to `#5A4F45` (5.2:1 ratio, passes)
- Badge font size changed from 9px (unreadable on mobile) to 11px minimum with 4px 10px padding
- Placeholder text color reviewed for contrast compliance
- Color must never be the sole indicator of state (critical for the 8% of males with deuteranopia)

**4. Section Color Cross-Contamination Rule (Refined)**
- The strict "never use colors from the wrong section" rule is maintained for accent colors
- However, the universal elements (Heritage Red, Pina backgrounds, T'nalak text, border color) appear everywhere
- The navigation and footer always use Heritage Red regardless of active section
- Rationale: Users will not perceive the textile mapping, and that is fine. The value is in visual cohesion and team alignment, not in user awareness of which tradition they are "in."

**5. AI Assistant Name: "Ate AI" Deferred**
- "Ate AI" is a working name only. It will not ship with the MVP.
- When we build the AI assistant (Phase 4), the name will be user-tested first.
- Concerns: The pun on "Ate" (older sister in Filipino) and "AI" is clever in writing but may not land in speech. A Filipino couple asking "Where do I find Ate AI?" out loud may sound confusing.
- **Decision:** Table the naming decision until Phase 4. The placeholder in documentation remains "AI Assistant."

**6. Cultural Authenticity Protocol**
- The brand reviewer flagged that T'nalak, Yakan, and Langkit textiles come from specific Indigenous communities (T'boli, Yakan, Maranao).
- **Decision:** Before public launch, we will: (a) add an "Our Heritage" page crediting each tradition with links to cultural organizations and weaver cooperatives, (b) budget for a micro-donation to weaving communities from future revenue, and (c) ensure the narrative is reviewed for respectfulness.
- We are drawing color inspiration, not reproducing sacred patterns. This distinction is important and must be communicated clearly.

### 4.3 The Inclusivity Approach (Final -- Resolves All Debates)

This is the single most debated topic across all research. Here is the final decision:

**Default UI language: "You" and "Your Partner"**

Not "Partner 1 / Partner 2." Not "Bride / Groom." The default experience uses warm, personal language:
- "Your name" and "Your partner's name"
- "Your checklist"
- "Your budget"
- "Your celebration"

**Full label customization available:**
During onboarding or in settings, couples can customize their labels. Options include:
- Their actual names (e.g., "Maria" and "Jose")
- "Bride" and "Groom" (for couples who want traditional terms)
- "Partner 1" and "Partner 2" (for couples who prefer neutral terms)
- Any custom text they want

**Why this works for everyone:**
- A straight Catholic couple sees "Your name" and "Your partner's name" -- warm, personal, not clinical. They can add "Bride" and "Groom" if they want.
- A same-sex couple sees the same thing -- no assumptions, no exclusion, no awkward "Partner 1" clinical label.
- The platform never forces anyone into a box. It starts with warmth and lets couples define their own terms.

**The "All Celebrations Welcome" badge remains as designed.** Vendors opt in. It is displayed on their profile. It is NOT the centerpiece of the brand. It is a signal that certain couples look for and other couples simply ignore.

**Imagery and content:** Real Celebrations will feature diverse couples naturally -- straight, LGBTQ+, intercultural, Catholic, Muslim, civil -- without making diversity the editorial thesis. The diversity IS the Philippines. We simply reflect reality.

## 5. MVP FEATURES (Final Scope)

### 5.1 What Ships in the MVP (Launch Day -- Target: April 11-14, 2026)

**Couple-Facing Features:**

| # | Feature | Description | Rationale |
|---|---------|-------------|-----------|
| 1 | **Homepage** | Hero with "The best way to plan a Filipino wedding," value proposition, CTA to browse vendors or start planning | First impression. Must communicate differentiation in 5 seconds. |
| 2 | **Vendor Directory** | Browse by category, filter by location/price range/badges, vendor card grid with photos | Core utility. This is why couples visit. |
| 3 | **Vendor Profile Pages** | Full profile with portfolio gallery, description, services, pricing range, location, contact info, badges | The detailed view that drives inquiry conversion. |
| 4 | **Planning Checklist** | Pre-built Filipino-specific checklist (12-month, 6-month, 3-month timelines), customizable, progress tracking | Sticky retention feature. Gives couples a reason to return weekly. |
| 5 | **Budget Tracker** | Category breakdown with Filipino wedding categories and typical PHP ranges, estimated vs. actual, running total | Second most requested tool. Pairs naturally with vendor browsing. |
| 6 | **Matchmaker Quiz** | 5-7 question visual quiz matching couples to vendors, generating a shareable results card for social media | The viral growth engine. Designed for Filipino social media behavior. |
| 7 | **User Authentication** | Google OAuth (primary) + email/password + magic link, via Supabase Auth | Required for saving data. Google OAuth is fastest for Filipino users. |
| 8 | **Vendor Favorites** | Save vendors to a personal shortlist with optional notes | Bridges browsing and planning. Low effort, high engagement. |
| 9 | **Inquiry Form** | Structured form requiring date, guest count, budget range, and personal message. One inquiry at a time. | Core marketplace interaction. Quality over quantity. |
| 10 | **Couple Onboarding** | Post-signup flow: names, date, ceremony type, budget. Auto-populates checklist and budget template. | Personalization hook. Makes the product feel tailored from moment one. |
| 11 | **About Page** | Brand story, Woven Heritage philosophy, Our Heritage credits, team | Builds trust. Important for PR and vendor recruitment. |
| 12 | **Mobile-Responsive Design** | Fully responsive, mobile-first (designed from 375px up) | 95%+ of Filipino users access via mobile. Non-negotiable. |
| 13 | **"All Celebrations Welcome" Badge** | Vendor opt-in badge displayed on cards and profiles | Differentiator. Costs nothing to implement. Signals values. |
| 14 | **SEO Implementation** | Meta tags, OG images, structured data for vendor profiles | Critical for organic discovery. Vendor names must be indexable. |
| 15 | **Woven Heritage Design System** | Full implementation of brand guide -- colors, typography, woven border, textile patterns, inclusive language | The brand IS the product at this stage. Must be flawless. |

**Vendor-Facing Features (MVP -- Minimal):**

| # | Feature | Description |
|---|---------|-------------|
| 1 | **Vendor Profile Page** | Public-facing profile (team-created, vendor can claim and edit) |
| 2 | **Claim Your Listing** | Simple flow: create account, verify ownership, edit profile form |
| 3 | **Inquiry Email Notifications** | Email alert when a couple sends an inquiry (via Resend) |

**Seeded Content:**

| Content | Target |
|---------|--------|
| Real Celebrations stories | 3-5 editorially curated stories at launch |
| Filipino wedding tradition guides | 3-5 guides (Catholic ceremony, Muslim ceremony, civil ceremony, Pre-Cana guide, ninong/ninang guide) |

### 5.2 The "Wow" Feature: The Matchmaker Quiz

This is the feature that makes people share. A short, visually engaging quiz (5-7 questions) that asks about celebration style, budget range, location, and vibe -- then generates a curated shortlist of vendors with a branded, shareable results card designed for Instagram Stories and Facebook.

**Why this is the "wow" feature:**
- In a country where 94.6% of people are on Facebook and the average person spends 3.5 hours daily on social media, shareable content is the primary growth engine.
- Filipino social behavior is inherently communal. When someone takes a fun quiz, they share the results. When their friends see the results, they take the quiz too. This is the viral loop.
- Every quiz completion generates data: couple preferences, budget ranges, location, style. This data feeds future AI recommendations.
- It is technically simple (rule-based matching, not AI) and emotionally satisfying.

**Quiz flow:**
1. "What's your celebration vibe?" (Intimate / Garden Party / Grand Ballroom / Destination / Beach / Cultural)
2. "What matters most?" (Photography / Food / Venue / Music / Everything)
3. "Where are you celebrating?" (Metro Manila / CALABARZON / Cebu / Other)
4. "What's your budget range?" (Under PHP 100K / 100K-300K / 300K-700K / 700K-1M / Over 1M)
5. "What's your style?" (Classic / Modern / Rustic / Cultural Heritage / Eclectic)
6. Results page: "Your Top 5 Vendors" with branded card for sharing
7. CTA: "Save these vendors" (requires sign-up) + "Share your results"

### 5.3 What Is Explicitly OUT (And Why)

| Feature | Why It Is Out | When It Ships |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| **AI Assistant ("Ate AI")** | Needs vendor data quality, prompt engineering, cost management. The quiz proves the matching concept first. | Phase 4 |
| **Community Forums** | Empty forums are anti-growth. Requires critical mass to be valuable. An empty forum on launch day screams "nobody uses this." | Phase 3 |
| **Guest List / RSVP Manager** | Complex feature (RSVP, meals, seating, plus-ones). Checklist + budget are enough to start. | Phase 2 |
| **Wedding Website Builder** | High development cost, low urgency. Couples already use Canva, Paperless Post, or Nuptials.ph for this. | Phase 3 |
| **Day-of Timeline Builder** | Only useful close to the wedding day. Most early users are 6-12 months out. | Phase 2 |
| **Vendor Self-Service Dashboard** | Manual onboarding is fine for the first 100 vendors. Full dashboard is Phase 2. | Phase 2 |
| **Native Mobile Apps** | Responsive web + PWA install prompt is sufficient. App Store approval adds weeks. One codebase. | Phase 4+ |
| **Payment / Booking System** | Premature. Filipino vendors accept bank transfer, GCash, and Maya. We are not ready for payment processing. | Phase 5 |
| **Vendor Analytics Dashboard** | Need traffic volume first. Analytics with 10 profile views is embarrassing, not useful. | Phase 3 |
| **Multi-language (Tagalog/Bisaya)** | English-first for MVP. Filipino code-switching in social media content only. | Phase 3 |

### 5.4 Technical Architecture

```
React 19 + TypeScript 5.8 + Vite 6 (Vercel)
     |
Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Storage + RLS)
     |
Resend (transactional email for inquiries)
     |
Plausible/PostHog (analytics)
```

**Total infrastructure cost: approximately PHP 1,500-3,000/month ($30-55 USD)**

The full database schema (12 tables with RLS policies) is defined in the MVP Launch Plan. Key architectural decision: hybrid vendor data approach. The team seeds vendor listings from public data; vendors claim and enrich their profiles later.

---

## 6. VENDOR ACQUISITION PLAYBOOK

### 6.1 The Wedding Fair Strategy

The founder's strategic insight: wedding fairs are where vendors and couples physically gather. The playbook:

1. **Before the fair:** Scrape the exhibitor list (published on the fair's website/social media). Research each vendor on Instagram and Facebook. Create listings on everaftr for every exhibitor.
2. **At the fair:** Walk the floor with a tablet. Approach each vendor: "Hi, we already created a listing for you on everaftr. Want to see it? You can claim it for free -- takes 2 minutes." Show them their profile on the platform.
3. **After the fair:** Email all unclaimed vendors with their listing link and an invitation to claim.

**Target fairs:**
- The Wedding Library Bridal Fair (World Trade Center Manila, 350+ suppliers)
- Getting Married Bridal Fair (SMX Convention Center, free admission, multiple dates per year)
- Toast Wedding Fair (run by Bride and Breakfast)
- Kasalang Tagaytay (100+ suppliers)

This strategy solves two problems simultaneously: it seeds the vendor directory AND creates in-person vendor relationships. A face-to-face interaction at a fair converts dramatically better than a cold DM.

### 6.2 The "Claim Your Profile" Approach

**Legal Framework:**
Pre-populating vendor profiles from publicly available data (Instagram, Facebook, Google Maps, Kasal.com directory) is legal and is standard marketplace practice (used by Yelp, Google My Business, early Airbnb, Zillow). Key requirements:
- Use only publicly available information
- Clearly mark profiles as "Unclaimed" until the vendor takes ownership
- Attribute photos to their source
- Allow vendors to request removal at any time
- Never misrepresent the listing as vendor-endorsed

**Ethical Guidelines:**
- Every unclaimed listing includes a prominent "Is this your business? Claim it for free" banner
- Photos used are from public social media with visible attribution
- Pricing is shown as estimated ranges, not exact figures
- The outreach message is transparent: "We found your business online and listed it because we think couples would love you"

**What vendor research tells us:**
Chef Marga (caterer persona): "If you just pulled my photos from Facebook and listed me without asking? I'd feel uneasy. But if you framed it nicely -- like 'we found your business and think brides would love you, claim your profile and take control' -- that's different. I'd probably claim it."

Photographer JC (photographer persona): "If it looks professional and it's positioned as 'we built this to help you get discovered,' I'd probably claim it. But I'd want full control."

**Decision:** Proceed with claim-your-profile, with transparent framing and full vendor control upon claiming.

### 6.3 Vendor Onboarding Flow by Type

**For Chef Marga (Caterer, Mid-Range, Facebook-First):**
- Discovery: She sees her listing at a wedding fair or gets a DM on Facebook
- Hook: "Your Kare-Kare station is legendary. We've already listed you -- want to see?"
- Onboarding: Simple form -- verify ownership, update description, upload 10 photos, set price range, opt into "All Celebrations Welcome" badge
- Retention: Monthly email showing profile views and inquiry count
- Her pain point solved: "I want a platform where the leads are already serious"

**For Photographer JC (Photographer, Instagram-First, Cebu-Based):**
- Discovery: Instagram DM with a link to his listing
- Hook: "We curated the best Cebu wedding photographers and you made our list"
- Onboarding: Import Instagram feed option (or upload portfolio), set availability calendar, set starting price
- Retention: SEO value -- his everaftr profile ranks for "Cebu wedding photographer" on Google
- His pain point solved: "I want couples searching Google to find me through the platform"

**For Coordinator Rodel (Wedding Coordinator, Word-of-Mouth, Taguig):**
- Discovery: Direct outreach as a "founding vendor partner"
- Hook: "Recommend vendors your clients will love, all in one place"
- Onboarding: Becomes an evangelist -- recommends the platform to both his vendor network and his couple clients
- Retention: "Featured Planner" status, direct line to the product team
- His pain point solved: "I need a central tool to show clients their vendor options"

### 6.4 Pricing: 100% Free to Start

**Phase 1 (0-500 vendors):** Everything is free. Basic listing, photos, inquiries, badges -- all free.
**Phase 2 (500-2,000 vendors, with measurable traffic):** Introduce optional "Featured" placement as a paid option. Keep basic listings free forever.
**Phase 3 (2,000+ vendors, proven lead flow):** Introduce tiered subscriptions. PHP 500-1,500/month for priority placement, analytics, and promoted profile.

**The commitment to vendors:** "Your basic listing is free. Always. We only make money when we can prove we are sending you real clients."

This is the opposite of TheKnot's model (pay first, hope later). It aligns our incentives with vendor success and builds trust in a market where trust is earned, not assumed.

## 7. USER ACQUISITION STRATEGY

### 7.1 First 100 Couples: Who and How

| Segment | Target | Where to Find Them | Hook |
|---------|--------|-------------------|------|
| Recently engaged (0-3 months) | 40 couples | Instagram #engagedph, Facebook groups (Weddings PH, Budget Wedding Philippines) | "Start planning with tools actually built for the Philippines" |
| Budget-conscious planners | 25 couples | TikTok (100K budget content is trending), MoneyMax/personal finance communities | "Track every peso. Find vendors that fit your budget." |
| LGBTQ+ couples | 15 couples | Pride PH organizations, LGBTQ+ Facebook groups, Open Table MCC network | "Finally, a platform that sees you." |
| OFW / Diaspora couples | 10 couples | Filipino communities abroad (US, UAE, SG), overseas-focused Facebook groups | "Plan your Philippine wedding from anywhere." |
| Wedding planner professionals | 10 planners | Direct outreach, Instagram, wedding coordinator networks | "Recommend vendors your clients will love." |

**The "Founding Couples" program:** 50 couples get early access during soft launch (Week 7-8). They receive a permanent "Founding Couple" badge, priority access to future features, and a direct Viber group with the product team. In return: feedback, bug reports, and testimonials.

### 7.2 Social Media Strategy

**Facebook (Awareness + Community):**
- everaftr Facebook Page with Woven Heritage branding
- Join and provide value in top wedding planning groups (NO spam -- answer questions, share tips, be helpful)
- Launch Founding Couples application via Facebook form
- Run targeted ads to recently engaged users in NCR + CALABARZON (PHP 5,000/week)
- Create a closed "everaftr Couples" Facebook Group as bridge community

**Instagram (Brand + Aspiration):**
- Visual-first content showcasing the Woven Heritage design system
- Behind-the-scenes of building everaftr (founder story resonates in PH)
- Vendor portfolio highlights (drives vendor recruitment AND couple engagement)
- Reels: Quick tips, vendor reveals, "Meet the couple" stories
- Partner with 3-5 micro-influencers (10K-50K followers) in wedding/lifestyle space

**TikTok (Discovery + Virality):**
- TikTok is #1 by time spent per user (40 hours/month) in the Philippines
- Content pillars: "Wedding Planning in PH" series, budget breakdowns, vendor reveals, "Things no one tells you about planning a Filipino wedding"
- Post 3-5x per week in Taglish (natural code-switching)
- Matchmaker Quiz results designed to be screenshot/video friendly

### 7.3 The Matchmaker Quiz as Viral Growth Engine

The quiz is not just a feature -- it is the primary acquisition channel.

**The loop:**
1. Couple takes quiz (2-3 minutes)
2. Gets personalized vendor results with a branded shareable card
3. Shares card on Instagram Stories / Facebook ("I just found my dream vendor team!")
4. Friends in their network see the card and take the quiz themselves
5. 20% share rate target = 200 shares from 1,000 completions = thousands of organic impressions

**Why this works in the Philippines specifically:**
- 94.6% Facebook penetration means the audience is there
- Average 3.5 hours daily on social media means they will see it
- 70% of Filipinos have purchased something based on influencer recommendations
- Filipino culture is communal -- sharing and recommending is natural behavior
- Wedding planning is inherently social ("Ayun, share ko lang, try niyo ito!")

### 7.4 Content Strategy: Filipino Wedding Data as Authority Play

Hitched.co.uk owns the UK wedding conversation because they publish the annual National Wedding Survey. When UK media says "the average wedding costs GBP 21,990," they cite Hitched. This is the authority play.

**everaftr will become the authoritative source on Filipino wedding data.**

Year 1 content plan:
- "How Much Does a Filipino Wedding Really Cost in 2026?" (Data-driven article with regional breakdowns)
- "The everaftr Filipino Wedding Report" (Annual survey of couples -- costs, trends, demographics, vendor satisfaction)
- "Pre-Cana Seminar Guide: Everything You Need to Know" (SEO play -- this is a high-search topic)
- "Catholic Wedding Requirements Checklist: The Complete Philippine Guide"
- "Wedding Vendors Philippines: Average Costs by Category and Region"

This content does triple duty: drives SEO traffic, establishes brand authority, and gives media outlets a reason to cite (and link to) everaftr.

## 8. THE 5 KILLER DIFFERENTIATORS

These are the five things that make everaftr defensible -- not just different, but structurally difficult for competitors to replicate.

### 1. Filipino Cultural Intelligence (The Deepest Moat)

No international platform can replicate understanding ninongs/ninangs as a sponsorship system, Pre-Cana as a scheduling nightmare, arrhae coins as a ceremony element, same-day edit videos as a vendor category, lechon debates as a catering decision, or the tita politics of guest list management. This knowledge runs through every checklist item, every budget category, every vendor classification, and every piece of content. TheKnot cannot localize to this level. Bridestory will not invest in this level. This is a moat built on cultural intimacy.

### 2. Inclusive by Design (The Structural Advantage)

Every competitor in the Philippine market uses "bride and groom." Kasal.com, Bride and Breakfast, Nuptials.ph, Weddings At Work -- all bride-focused in language, imagery, and assumptions. everaftr's architecture is gender-neutral from the database schema up. The `couples` table has `partner1_name` and `partner2_name`. The ceremony type enum includes `civil_union`. The "All Celebrations Welcome" badge is built into the vendor model. Retrofitting inclusivity into an existing bride-focused platform is extremely difficult. Building it from scratch is our advantage.

### 3. The Woven Heritage Brand Identity (The Visual Moat)

Six Filipino textile traditions mapped to six platform sections. Heritage Red from T'nalak. Indigo from Inabel. Green from Hablon. Fuchsia from Yakan. Violet from Langkit. The woven border as a signature element. No competitor has a design system this culturally grounded, this visually distinctive, or this deeply researched. Copying the color palette is possible; copying the narrative and meaning behind it is not.

### 4. Vendor Trust Architecture (The Anti-TheKnot Moat)

Every decision about vendor relationships is the opposite of TheKnot: no long-term contracts (month-to-month only), no pay-to-play ranking (merit-based), no mass-inquiry spam (one-at-a-time with required fields), and vendors own their profiles completely. In a market where TheKnot has a 1.4/5 Trustpilot rating and a class action lawsuit, being the platform that treats vendors fairly is a real differentiator. Vendor trust compounds over time and is extremely expensive for a competitor to buy back once lost.

### 5. Filipino Wedding Data Repository (The Authority Moat)

Whoever builds the definitive dataset on Filipino wedding costs, vendor reviews, ceremony trends, and regional variations first will own the SEO authority and media citations for the category. This is a compounding asset -- every data point, every review, every Real Celebration story makes the dataset more valuable. It takes years for a competitor to build this from zero.

## 9. ADDRESSING THE DEVIL'S ADVOCATE

The devil's advocate report was the most valuable research output. Every concern was legitimate. Here are the team's responses:

### "There is no code. The documentation-to-code ratio is inverted."

**Acknowledged.** The project has 44KB of planning documents and 0KB of working software. This was deliberate -- we invested in strategic clarity before writing a single line of code. The brand system, competitive analysis, market research, user personas, vendor personas, and MVP plan are now complete. The planning phase is OVER. The 8-week build sprint starts February 17, 2026. Code ships every week. The first deployable version exists by Week 3 (vendor directory with search).

### "Partner 1/Partner 2 in one of the most Catholic countries in Asia."

**Accepted and revised.** The original "Partner 1 / Partner 2 always, non-negotiable" stance was too rigid. The revised approach: default to warm personalization ("You" and "Your Partner"), allow full label customization (including "Bride" and "Groom" for those who want it), and never force clinical terminology on anyone. Inclusivity is built into the architecture, not imposed through the interface. See Section 4.3 for the full decision.

### "The cold-start problem is lethal for wedding marketplaces."

**Solved through the three-phase vendor seeding strategy:** (1) Pre-populate 100 listings from public data before inviting a single couple, (2) recruit 50 high-value vendors through direct outreach, (3) enlist 5-10 wedding coordinators as evangelist partners. The platform will never have an empty-directory moment. Couples will always find vendors to browse, even if many are unclaimed. The Matchmaker Quiz and Planning Tools provide value even if no vendor has claimed their profile.

### "Why not just use Facebook?"

**Because Facebook is a feed, not a tool.** You cannot filter vendors by price range in a Facebook group. You cannot track your budget. You cannot search for "Tagaytay caterer under PHP 500 per head." You cannot save a vendor to a shortlist. You cannot send a structured inquiry with your date and guest count. You cannot compare vendors side by side. Facebook groups are great for chismis and recommendations from friends. everaftr is for structured planning. The two coexist -- they do not compete.

### "Bridestory, Bride and Breakfast, or TheKnot could crush you."

**The cultural moat argument:**
- **Bridestory** has not invested meaningfully in the Philippines since 2017. Their last PH trends report was nine years ago. If they were going to dominate the PH market, they would have done it already. Their core market is Indonesia, and they lack Filipino cultural depth.
- **Bride and Breakfast** is a content company, not a platform company. They have no planning tools, no vendor marketplace, and no transaction layer. They could build these -- but it would require a fundamental pivot from media to SaaS. Their brand is also tied to "Bride," making an inclusive pivot difficult. We should approach B&B as a potential content partner, not a competitor.
- **TheKnot** just launched a ChatGPT app for the US market. Their global expansion strategy has historically focused on acquiring existing platforms (Hitched UK, Bodas.net Spain) rather than building from scratch. The Philippines is not on their radar. If everaftr proves the market, the most likely outcome is acquisition interest, not competitive destruction.
- **The real moat** is cultural intimacy + vendor relationships + data. By the time any international player notices the Philippine market, we will have the vendor network, the couple data, the content authority, and the brand recognition that make us the obvious acquisition target or the entrenched incumbent.

### "The Woven Heritage textile system -- authentic or appropriation?"

**Addressed in Section 4.2.** We are drawing color inspiration from textile traditions, not reproducing sacred patterns. Our brand guide uses CSS gradients and subtle background patterns at 0.03-0.08 opacity -- these are abstract, not representational. We will credit each tradition on an "Our Heritage" page, link to cultural organizations and weaving cooperatives, and budget for community support once revenue allows. This transforms the concept from extraction to active honoring.

## 11. SUCCESS METRICS (30/60/90 Day)

### North Star Metric: Vendor Inquiries Sent Per Week

This single metric captures both sides of the marketplace. If couples are sending inquiries, they found vendors worth contacting. If vendors are receiving inquiries, the platform is delivering value. Everything flows from this number.

### 30 Days Post-Launch: Proof We Are On Track

| Metric | Target | What It Proves |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| Registered couples | 100 | Acquisition channels are working |
| Vendor listings (total) | 120 | Supply side has critical mass for browsing |
| Claimed vendor profiles | 20 | Vendors are engaging, not just passively listed |
| Vendor inquiries sent | 50 total | Marketplace interaction is happening |
| Matchmaker Quiz completions | 300 | Top-of-funnel engagement works |
| Quiz result shares | 50 (17% share rate) | Viral loop is activating |
| Weekly active couples (WAU) | 40 | People are coming back, not just signing up |
| Critical bugs reported | <5 unresolved | Platform is stable |

### 60 Days Post-Launch: Product-Market Fit Signals

|--------|--------|---------------|
| Registered couples | 300 | Sustained growth beyond launch spike |
| Weekly active couples | 100 (33% WAU/MAU) | Retention is healthy |
| Vendor inquiries per week | 25+ | Marketplace is generating real value |
| Checklist items completed | 1,000+ total | Planning tools are sticky |
| Vendor claim rate (outreach to claim) | 30%+ | Vendor value proposition resonates |
| Organic search traffic | 500+ monthly visits | SEO is building |
| NPS score (from survey) | 35+ | Couples would recommend to friends |
| At least 1 vendor reports a booking from everaftr | YES/NO | Actual marketplace value delivered |

### 90 Days Post-Launch: Proof We Should Invest More

| Metric | Target | What It Proves |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| Registered couples | 500 | Momentum is compounding |
| Weekly active couples | 150 (30% WAU/MAU) | Sustained retention, not decay |
| Vendor listings (total) | 200 | Supply is growing organically (vendors requesting to be listed) |
| Claimed vendor profiles | 50 | Active vendor community forming |
| Total vendor inquiries | 300+ | Marketplace is real, not theoretical |
| Inquiries per week | 50+ (accelerating) | Growth rate is increasing |
| Matchmaker Quiz completions | 1,000 | Top-of-funnel is strong |
| Quiz share rate | 20%+ | Viral loop is proven |
| Organic traffic | 1,000+ monthly | SEO authority building |
| NPS score | 40+ | Strong recommendation likelihood |
| Media mention or feature | At least 1 | Brand is getting noticed |
| Phase 2 feature requests from users | Documented | Users want more -- signal of product-market fit |

### What We Do NOT Optimize For (Yet)

| Metric | Why We Ignore It |
|--------|-----------------|
| Revenue | Phase 1 is free. Charging too early kills growth. |
| Vendor count above 200 | Quality over quantity. 200 great vendors beats 1,000 stale listings. |
| Feature count | Ship fewer features better, not more features worse. |
| App downloads | No native app in MVP. Do not track this. |

## 12. THE ONE-LINER

After synthesizing 11 research reports, 5 couple personas, 6 vendor personas, competitive analysis of TheKnot and Hitched, a devil's advocate teardown, a comprehensive market study, and a detailed MVP plan, the positioning for everaftr is:

> **everaftr is the best way to plan a Filipino wedding -- built for every couple, rooted in Filipino heritage, and designed to replace the chaos of Facebook groups with tools that actually work.**

This is the sentence the whole team rallies around. It leads with utility ("best way to plan"), establishes cultural identity ("Filipino heritage"), defines the enemy ("chaos of Facebook groups"), and promises the solution ("tools that actually work"). Inclusivity is woven into "every couple" -- present but not performative.

*Six threads. One platform. Every couple.*

**everaftr** -- plan together, celebrate forevr

> **Document Status:** This Executive Strategy Brief is the single source of truth for the everaftr founding team. All debates referenced in this document are resolved. The planning phase is complete. Build starts February 17, 2026.
